\title{Time varying microcephaly risk AUX}
\usage{
generate_probM_forecast_OLD(riskI, probM, bp, abortion_rate, birth_reduction,
  switch_t, abortion_time)
}
\arguments{
\item{riskI}{the relative risk of infection over time as generated by generate_riskI}

\item{probM}{the time varying risk of developing microcephaly given infection over the course of gestation. Time steps should be the same as riskI}

\item{bp}{the baseline probability of microcephaly}

\item{abortion_rate}{probability of a women getting an abortion given that she was infected}

\item{birth_reduction}{reduced probability of getting infected, synonymous with probability of avoiding pregnancy}

\item{switch_t}{integer for index after which behaviour changes}

\item{abortion_time}{integer for last allowable abortion day/week}
}
\value{
the vector of microcephaly probabilities
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of a birth having microcephaly at a given time
}
