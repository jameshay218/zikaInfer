Although serum from some patients had IgM antibody against dengue virus, the illness seemed clinically distinct from previously detected dengue. Subsequent testing with the use of consensus primers detected Zika virus RNA in the serum of the patients but no dengue virus or other arboviral RNA. No previous outbreaks and only 14 cases of Zika virus disease have been previously documented. Methods We obtained serum samples from patients and interviewed patients for information on clinical signs and symptoms. Zika virus disease was confirmed by a finding of Zika virus RNA or a specific neutralizing antibody response to Zika virus in the serum. Patients with IgM antibody against Zika virus who had a potentially cross-reactive neutralizing-antibody response were classified as having probable Zika virus disease.

@article{Faria2016,
abstract = {Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with $\sim$30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015 and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in November 2015. Using next generation sequencing we generated seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes, sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, estimated to have occurred between May-Dec 2013, more than 12 months prior to the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV endemic areas, and with reported outbreaks in Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology in the Americas of this emerging virus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection. METHODS In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. FINDINGS We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28-0.88). CONCLUSION Neither symptom- nor antibody-based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high-incidence areas.},

abstract = {During 2015 to 2016, Brazil reported more Zika virus (ZIKV) cases than any other country, yet population exposure remains unknown. Serological studies of ZIKV are hampered by cross-reactive immune responses against heterologous viruses. We conducted serosurveys for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in 633 individuals prospectively sampled during 2015 to 2016, including microcephaly and non-microcephaly pregnancies, HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis patients, and university staff in Salvador in northeastern Brazil using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests. Sera sampled retrospectively during 2013 to 2015 from 277 HIV-infected patients were used to assess the spread of ZIKV over time. Individuals were georeferenced, and sociodemographic indicators were compared between ZIKV-positive and -negative areas and areas with and without microcephaly cases. Epidemiological key parameters were modeled in a Bayesian framework. ZIKV seroprevalence increased rapidly during 2015 to 2016, reaching 63.3% by 2016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.4 to 66.8%), comparable to the seroprevalence of DENV (75.7%; CI, 69.4 to 81.1%) and higher than that of CHIKV (7.4%; CI, 5.6 to 9.8%). Of 19 microcephaly pregnancies, 94.7% showed ZIKV IgG antibodies, compared to 69.3% of 257 non-microcephaly pregnancies (P = 0.017). Analyses of sociodemographic data revealed a higher ZIKV burden in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas. High seroprevalence, combined with case data dynamics allowed estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 of 2.1 (CI, 1.8 to 2.5) at the onset of the outbreak and an effective reproductive number Reff of <1 in subsequent years. Our data corroborate ZIKV-associated congenital disease and an association of low SES and ZIKV infection and suggest that population immunity caused cessation of the outbreak. Similar studies from other areas will be required to determine the fate of the American ZIKV outbreak.IMPORTANCE The ongoing American Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak involves millions of cases and has a major impact on maternal and child health. Knowledge of infection rates is crucial to project future epidemic patterns and determine the absolute risk of microcephaly upon maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy. For unknown reasons, the vast majority of ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases are concentrated in northeastern Brazil. We analyzed different subpopulations from Salvador, a Brazilian metropolis representing one of the most affected areas during the American ZIKV outbreak. We demonstrate rapid spread of ZIKV in Salvador, Brazil, and infection rates exceeding 60%. We provide evidence for the link between ZIKV and microcephaly, report that ZIKV predominantly affects geographic areas with low socioeconomic status, and show that population immunity likely caused cessation of the outbreak. Our results enable stakeholders to identify target populations for vaccination and for trials on vaccine efficacy and allow refocusing of research efforts and intervention strategies.},

In Salvador, Brazil, outbreaks of acute exanthematous illness (AEI) attributed to Zika virus, Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS), and microcephaly occurred in 2015. We investigated temporal correlations and time lags between these outbreaks to identify a common link between them by using epidemic curves and time series cross-correlations. Number of GBS cases peaked after a lag of 5-9 weeks from the AEI peak. Number of suspected cases of microcephaly peaked after a lag of 30-33 weeks from the AEI peak, which corresponded to time of potential infections of pregnant mothers during the first trimester. These findings support the association of GBS and microcephaly with Zika virus infection and provide evidence for a temporal relationship between timing of arboviral infection of pregnant women during the first trimester and birth outcome.},

abstract = {(1) An adult population of Aedes aegypti was studied in the residential compound of a Buddhist temple, Wat Samphaya, in Bangkok. The objectives of the study were to measure possible changes in population size, survival rate and movement throughout the year in order to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in these parameters accounted for the resurgence of A. aegypti-transmitted dengue haemorrhagic fever during the wet season. Concurrent studies were made of larval populations both in Wat Samphaya and elsewhere in and around Bangkok. (2) Mark-release-recapture techniques were used for estimating the adult population parameters. Each wild-caught mosquito before release was etherized and given a unique number by marking with spots of quick-drying paint on the wings and/or thorax. (3) A comparison of the amount of blood in the stomach and the ovarian condition of individual females recaptured on more than one occasion showed little correlation between the feeding pattern and ovarian development. The presence of fresh blood in a proportion of gravid and semi-gravid females made it impractical to score their ovarian stage unequivocably without dissection. Consequently, it proved impossible to measure the average length of the gonotrophic cycle in the wild population. (4) Dispersal of individual mosquitoes was studied by observing the distance each had moved between release and subsequent recapture. Both sexes tended to move further in the first 24-h period after release than later, perhaps because of the effects of handling. There was no evidence of an effect of the time of the year on the amount of movement, nor was there any difference in this respect between the sexes. Although it was found that males moved more than females in the first 24 h, the females lived longer and therefore ultimately moved at least as far. It was estimated that only about 40% of individuals released at random in the study area (94 X 56 m) remained there after 24 h. Taking into account this loss, the mean distance moved by mosquitoes in 24 h was estimated to be 37 m. Despite this movement, the mosquitoes were not randomly distributed among the rooms, probably owing to some rooms being more attractive than others rather than to a non-random distribution of breeding places. (5) The 24-h survival rate using the model developed by Fisher & Ford (1947), averaged over 12 months, was 0.70 for males and 0.81 for females. There was no significant difference in the values between months but there was between the sexes. A population model developed to take into account movement in and out of the study area gave mean rates of 0.72 for males and 0.84 for females, again with no difference between months but a significant difference between sexes. The estimates of survival rate are too low because of permanent emigration of some marked insects. An adjusted rate obtained from an estimate of the number of new mosquitoes emerging in the study area was 0.88 for both sexes combined, giving an expectation of life of 8.5 days. (6) Estimates of population size were obtained using the models of Fisher & Ford and of Jolly (1965) as well as the model which took into account movement. There was no significant difference in size between the male and female populations, but there was some evidence that population size may change from time to time. The changes were not correlated in any simple way with temperature or rainfall and there was no striking increase in population size in the wet season. The estimate of the mean daily population over the year, corrected for movement, was 1120, whilst that using the Jolly model was 1093. (7) It is suggested that the normal procedure of fogging with insecticide within a circle of radius 60 m, the centre being a house where a case of dengue haemorrhagic fever occurred, is not likely to kill more than 50% of infected mosquitoes. (8) The study indicates that the fluctuations in the amount of movement, the expectation of life and the population size throughout the year are inadequate to account for changes in the incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever.},
