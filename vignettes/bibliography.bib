abstract = {The current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in South America is one of the most serious public health emergencies since the Ebola outbreak of West Africa [2014]. ZIKV belongs to the flaviviridae family and has two lineages (Asian and African). The virus was first discovered in Uganda [1947] and the first human infection was identified in Nigeria [1952]. The current epidemic is the third of its type after that of Yap Island, Micronesia [2007] and French Polynesia [2013]. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the current strain shares about 99.7{\%} of nucleotides and 99.9{\%} of amino acids with the strain of French Polynesia epidemic [2013], suggesting that it has spread across the Pacific Ocean to invade South America. Aedes Aegypti mosquito is the main vector for ZIKV and there are some reports describing possible sexual and maternal to fetal transmission. ZIKV infection is known to be self-limited. However, recent reports suggested that it can be associated with neurological manifestations as Guillan-Barr{\`{e}} Syndrome and microcephaly in the newborn population. Currently, vector control seems to be the most effective available preventive measure against ZIKV spread. The development of broad spectrum antivirals and ZIKV vaccines should be a priority of future research.},

abstract = {Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and infection can be asymptomatic or result in an acute febrile illness with rash (1). Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe birth defects (2). Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS) (3) and severe thrombocytopenia (4,5). In December 2015, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) reported the first locally acquired case of Zika virus infection. This report provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico (6,7). A confirmed case of Zika virus infection is defined as a positive result for Zika virus testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Zika virus in a blood or urine specimen. A presumptive case is defined as a positive result by Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA)* and a negative result by dengue virus IgM ELISA, or a positive test result by Zika IgM MAC-ELISA in a pregnant woman. An unspecified flavivirus case is defined as positive or equivocal results for both Zika and dengue virus by IgM ELISA. During November 1, 2015-July 7, 2016, a total of 23,487 persons were evaluated by PRDH and CDC Dengue Branch for Zika virus infection, including asymptomatic pregnant women and persons with signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease or suspected GBS; 5,582 (24{\%}) confirmed and presumptive Zika virus cases were identified. Persons with Zika virus infection were residents of 77 (99{\%}) of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities. During 2016, the percentage of positive Zika virus infection cases among symptomatic males and nonpregnant females who were tested increased from 14{\%} in February to 64{\%} in June. Among 9,343 pregnant women tested, 672 had confirmed or presumptive Zika virus infection, including 441 (66{\%}) symptomatic women and 231 (34{\%}) asymptomatic women. One patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia (4). Evidence of Zika virus infection or recent unspecified flavivirus infection was detected in 21 patients with confirmed GBS. The widespread outbreak and accelerating increase in the number of cases in Puerto Rico warrants intensified vector control and personal protective behaviors to prevent new infections, particularly among pregnant women.},

abstract = {The microcephaly epidemic in Brazil generated intense debate regarding its causality, and one hypothesised cause of this epidemic, now recognised as congenital Zika virus syndrome, was the treatment of drinking water tanks with pyriproxyfen to control Aedes aegypti larvae. We present the results of a geographical analysis of the association between the prevalence of microcephaly confirmed by Fenton growth charts and the type of larvicide used in the municipalities that were home to the mothers of the affected newborns in the metropolitan region of Recife in Pernambuco, the state in Brazil where the epidemic was first detected. The overall prevalence of microcephaly was 82 per 10,000 live births in the three municipalities that used the larvicide Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) instead of pyriproxyfen, and 69 per 10,000 live births in the eleven municipalities that used pyriproxyfen. The difference was not statistically significant. Our results show that the prevalence of microcephaly was not higher in the areas in which pyriproxyfen was used. In this ecological approach, there was no evidence of a correlation between the use of pyriproxyfen in the municipalities and the microcephaly epidemic.},

@article{Amanna2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintenance of long-term antibody responses is critical for protective immunity against many pathogens. However, the duration of humoral immunity and the role played by memory B cells remain poorly defined. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers specific for viral antigens (vaccinia, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus) and nonreplicating antigens (tetanus and diphtheria) in 45 subjects for a period of up to 26 years. In addition, we measured antigen-specific memory B cells by means of limiting-dilution analysis, and we compared memory B-cell frequencies to their corresponding serum antibody levels. RESULTS: Antiviral antibody responses were remarkably stable, with half-lives ranging from an estimated 50 years for varicella-zoster virus to more than 200 years for other viruses such as measles and mumps. Antibody responses against tetanus and diphtheria antigens waned more quickly, with estimated half-lives of 11 years and 19 years, respectively. B-cell memory was long-lived, but there was no significant correlation between peripheral memory B-cell numbers and antibody levels for five of the eight antigens tested. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide quantitative analysis of serologic memory for multiple antigens in subjects followed longitudinally over the course of more than one decade. In cases in which multiple exposures or repeated vaccinations were common, memory B-cell numbers did not correlate with antibody titers. This finding suggests that peripheral memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells may represent independently regulated cell populations and may play different roles in the maintenance of protective immunity.},

abstract = {Generating a broadly protective influenza vaccine is critical to global health. Understanding how immune memory influences influenza immunity is central to this goal. We undertook an in-depth study of the B cell response to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine over consecutive years. Analysis of monoclonal antibodies generated from vaccine-induced plasmablasts demonstrated that individuals with low preexisting serological titers to the vaccinating strain generated a broadly reactive, hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-biased response. Higher preexisting serum antibody levels correlated with a strain-specific HA head-dominated response. We demonstrate that this HA head immunodominance encompasses poor accessibility of the HA stalk epitopes. Further, we show polyreactivity of HA stalk-reactive antibodies that could cause counterselection of these cells. Thus, preexisting memory B cells against HA head epitopes predominate, inhibiting a broadly protective response against the HA stalk upon revaccination with similar strains. Consideration of influenza exposure history is critical for new vaccine strategies designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {MF59 is already known to enhance the breadth of antibody response to mismatched influenza seasonal and avian strains. However, little is known on the effect of MF59 on immunogenicity of influenza vaccines when "apparent" good matching between circulating and vaccine strains exists. To this end, we compared the immune response elicited by MF59-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted subunit vaccine, containing A/California/7/04(H3N2) strain, against circulating viruses isolated between 2004/2005 and 2006/2007 seasons, belonging to different clades. The advantage offered by MF59 in terms of higher immunogenicity, expressed as higher post-vaccination HI titres, is observable also against viruses showing antigenic and molecular pattern undistinguishable from vaccine strain, but it became even more evident as the antigenic and molecular distance between vaccine and circulating strains grew. These data show that seasonal influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 can offer a stronger benefit as compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine in protecting against a broader range of virus strains circulating during the influenza season.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although microcephaly is the most prominent feature of congenital Zika syndrome, a spectrum with less severe cases is starting to be recognized. Our aim was to review neuroimaging of infants to detect cases without microcephaly and compare them with those with microcephaly. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all neuroimaging (MR imaging/CT) of infants 1 year of age or younger. Patients with congenital Zika syndrome were divided into those with microcephaly at birth, postnatal microcephaly, and without microcephaly. Neuroimaging was compared among groups. RESULTS Among 77 infants, 24.6{\%} had congenital Zika syndrome (11.7{\%} microcephaly at birth, 9.1{\%} postnatal microcephaly, 3.9{\%} without microcephaly). The postnatal microcephaly and without microcephaly groups showed statistically similar imaging findings. The microcephaly at birth compared with the group without microcephaly showed statistically significant differences for the following: reduced brain volume, calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junctions, corpus callosum abnormalities, moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly, an enlarged extra-axial space, an enlarged cisterna magna (all absent in those without microcephaly), and polymicrogyria (the only malformation present without microcephaly). There was a trend toward pachygyria (absent in groups without microcephaly). The group with microcephaly at birth compared with the group with postnatal microcephaly showed significant differences for simplified gyral pattern, calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junctions, corpus callosum abnormalities, moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly, and an enlarged extra-axial space. CONCLUSIONS In microcephaly at birth, except for polymicrogyria, all patients showed abnormalities described in the literature. In postnatal microcephaly, the only abnormalities not seen were a simplified gyral pattern and calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junction. Infants with normocephaly presented with asymmetric frontal polymicrogyria, calcifications in the cortico-subcortical junction, mild ventriculomegaly, and delayed myelination.},

abstract = {Maternal dengue antibodies are considered to play a significant role in dengue pathogenesis among infants. Determining the transplacental specific antibody transfer is invaluable for establishing the optimal vaccination age among infants in endemic regions. We conducted a cross-sectional study among pairs of maternal and corresponding umbilical cord blood samples in public hospitals. The prevalence and incidence of dengue infection were determined in 505 pairs of pregnant women and neonates during a large outbreak (2009–2010) in central Brazil. The women were interviewed at late pregnancy to assess current or past symptoms of dengue. All parturients and their neonates were screened using Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA (Panbio) to assess previous dengue exposure. A semi-quantitative measurement of the IgG antibody expressed by the index ratio was calculated using optical density (OD) values according to the manufacturer's instructions. The studied population of parturients and their offspring was also screened for recent dengue infection by the Dengue IgM-capture ELISA (Panbio). Those participants with history of fever and two or more symptoms of dengue at least 10 days before the delivery were also tested for the dengue NS1 antigen using the Dengue Early ELISA (Panbio) and RT-PCR. The mean maternal age was 25.8 (SD = 6.4), and 83.6{\%} of deliveries were between 37 and 41 weeks. Approximately half of the 505 women and neonates were IgG-seropositive, yielding 99.3{\%} co-positive mother-child frequency of antibody transfer (Kappa = 0.96). The incidence of dengue infection was 2.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.4–4.4{\%}) among the women considering 14 IgM-positive results and one DENV2 detected by RT-PCR. The dengue NS1 antigen was undetectable in the matched pairs. This study provides critical data on the prevalence of transplacental transferred maternal-infant anti-dengue antibodies and incidence of infection. The design of future vaccine trials should consider diverse regional epidemiological scenarios.},

abstract = {Currently, little is known about the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection within an individual. We utilize a series of mathematical models of increasing complexity, which incorporate target cell limitation and the innate interferon response, to examine influenza A virus kinetics in the upper respiratory tracts of experimentally infected adults. The models were fit to data from an experimental H1N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/123/77 infection and suggest that it is important to include the eclipse phase of the viral life cycle in viral dynamic models. Doing so, we estimate that after a delay of approximately 6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for approximately 5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is approximately 11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 3 h. We calculated the basic reproductive number, R(0), which indicated that a single infected cell could produce approximately 22 new productive infections. This suggests that antiviral treatments have a large hurdle to overcome in moderating symptoms and limiting infectiousness and that treatment has to be initiated as early as possible. For about 50{\%} of patients, the curve of viral titer versus time has two peaks. This bimodal behavior can be explained by incorporating the antiviral effects of interferon into the model. Our model also compared well to an additional data set on viral titer after experimental infection and treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which suggests that such models may prove useful in estimating the efficacies of different antiviral therapies for influenza A infection.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Backcalculation is an important method for reconstructing past rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and for estimating current prevalence of HIV infection and future incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This paper reviews the backcalculation technique, focusing on the key assumptions of the method, including the necessary information regarding incubation, re-porting delay, and models for the infection curve. A summary is given of the extent to which the appropriate external information is available and whether checks of the relevant assumptions are possible through use of data on AIDS incidence from surveillance systems. A likelihood approach to backcalculation is described and implemented on AIDS incidence data in the United States. New features of the approach include incorporation of seasonal variation in diagnosis rates, smooth nonparametric estimation of both the HIV infection curve and nonsta-tionary aspects of the incubation period and reporting delay distributions, and an analysis of residuals from backcalculation fits. Unexplained lack of fit is examined and discussed. A fundamental concern is the appro-priate acknowledgment of uncertainty associated with backcalculation estimates caused by misspecified assumptions and inaccurate external estimates of key components of the technique. Such uncertainty limits the usefulness of backcalculation and highlights the need for complemen-tary approaches.},

abstract = {Estimating the age-specific incidence of an emerging pathogen is essential for understanding its severity and transmission dynamics. This paper describes a statistical method that uses likelihoods to estimate incidence from sequential serological data. The method requires information on seroconversion intervals and allows integration of information on the temporal distribution of cases from clinical surveillance. Among a family of candidate incidences, a likelihood function is derived by reconstructing the change in seroprevalence from seroconversion following infection and comparing it with the observed sequence of positivity among the samples. This method is applied to derive the cumulative and weekly incidence of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza in England during the second wave using sera taken between September 2009 and February 2010 in four age groups (1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-44 years). The highest cumulative incidence was in 5-14 year olds (59{\%}, 95{\%} credible interval (CI): 52{\%}, 68{\%}) followed by 1-4 year olds (49{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 38{\%}, 61{\%}), rates 20 and 40 times higher respectively than estimated from clinical surveillance. The method provides a more accurate and continuous measure of incidence than achieved by comparing prevalence in samples grouped by time period.},

Using a stochastic simulation model of influenza transmission, the authors assessed strategies for vaccinating children in the United States, varying the vaccine type, coverage level, and reproductive number R (average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case). Results indicated that vaccinating children can substantially reduce population-level illness attack rates over a wide range of scenarios. The greatest absolute reduction in influenza illness cases per season occurred at R values ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 for a given vaccine coverage level. The indirect, total, and overall effects of vaccinating children were strong when transmission intensity was low to intermediate. The indirect effects declined rapidly as transmission intensity increased. In a mild influenza season (R = 1.1), approximately 19 million influenza cases could be prevented by vaccinating 70{\%} of children. At most, nearly 100 million cases of influenza illness could be prevented, depending on the proportion of children vaccinated and the transmission intensity. Given the current worldwide threat of novel influenza A (H1N1), with an estimated R of 1.4-1.6, health officials should consider strategies for vaccinating children against novel influenza A (H1N1) as well as seasonal influenza.},

In order to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneities on viral spread, a simple 2-D cellular automaton (CA) model of a viral infection has been developed. In this initial phase of the investigation, the CA model is validated against clinical immunological data for uncomplicated influenza A infections. Our results will be shown and discussed.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and
circulation of new human seasonal influenza virus variants is a
key scientific and public health challenge. The global
circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well
characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have
remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global
circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and
B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2
viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin
sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2012.
Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist
locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East and
Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses
persisted across several seasons and exhibited complex global
dynamics with East and Southeast Asia playing a limited role in
disseminating new variants. The less frequent global movement of
influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower rates of
antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less
frequent epidemics compared to A/H3N2 viruses. Detailed epidemic
models support differences in age of infection, combined with the
less frequent travel of children, as probable drivers of the
differences in the patterns of global circulation, suggesting a
complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology, and
human behaviour.},

The antigenic distance hypothesis provided a theoretical framework to explain variability in repeat vaccination effects based on antigenic similarity between successive vaccine components and the epidemic strain.Areas covered: A meta-analysis of vaccine effectiveness studies from 2010–11 through 2014–15 shows substantial heterogeneity in repeat vaccination effects within and between seasons and subtypes. When negative effects were observed, they were most pronounced for H3N2, especially in 2014–15 when vaccine components were unchanged and antigenically distinct from the epidemic strain. Studies of repeated vaccination across multiple seasons suggest that vaccine effectiveness may be influenced by more than one prior season.

abstract = {Serological parameters intend to describe antibody response to influenza vaccine in a population. However, there is uncertainty about the mathematical appropriateness and the biological or clinical meaning of conventionally used parameters. Theoretical considerations and exploration of a data-set of 16 studies with an inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine involving 1176 adult subjects suggest the following conclusions. In a population seronegative before vaccination, the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (post-GMT) is a meaningful immunological parameter adequately expressing antibody response after vaccination. The related protection rate (PR) is a good surrogate parameter for protection provided by a given vaccine, thus relevant to public health. However, in a population partially seropositive before vaccination (due to previous exposition to influenza antigens), the same parameters may, under certain conditions, seriously overestimate the antibody response, as they do not account for the pre-vaccination state. Conventional attempts to address pre-vaccination antibody are associated with either loss of information (exclusion of seropositive subjects) or incomplete control of pre-vaccination state (mean fold increase (MFI), response rate (RR)). Although not devoid of theoretical limitations (heteroscedasticity), correction of post-GMT and PR by linear regression appears to provide better estimates of antibody response and vaccine immunogenicity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 1:40, which has been recognized as an immunologic correlate corresponding to a 50{\%} reduction in the risk of contracting influenza, is based on studies in adults. Neither seasonal nor challenge-based correlates have been evaluated in children. METHODS A total of 4707 influenza vaccine-naive healthy children 6 to 72 months old were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive 2 doses of MF-59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Novartis Vaccines), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine subunit (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine control, GSK), or a saline placebo during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 influenza seasons. The second dose was given 30 days after dose 1. Clinical influenza-like illnesses cases identified by active surveillance were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza. Vaccine immunogenicity 50 days after dose 1 was evaluated in a subset of 777 children. RESULTS Immunogenicity and efficacy results for H3N2 were evaluated against the Prentice criteria, which confirmed that the immunogenicity results warranted estimation of an immunologic correlate. We then used the Dunning model fitting the H3N2 antibody titers at day 50 and the influenza cases observed in the immunogenicity subset to estimate a correlate of protection. This analysis revealed that a cutoff HI titer of 1:110 was associated with the conventional 50{\%} clinical protection rate against infection during the entire season, and titers of 1:215, 1:330, and 1:629 predicated protection rates of 70{\%}, 80{\%}, and 90{\%}, respectively. The conventional adult HI titer of 1:40 was only associated with 22{\%} protection. CONCLUSIONS The use of the 1:40 HI adult correlate of protection is not appropriate when evaluating influenza vaccines in children. Although a cutoff of 1:110 may be used to predict the conventional 50{\%} clinical protection rate, a titer of 1:330 would predict an 80{\%} protective level, which would seem to be more desirable from a public health perspective.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 1:40, which has been recognized as an immunologic correlate corresponding to a 50{\%} reduction in the risk of contracting influenza, is based on studies in adults. Neither seasonal nor challenge-based correlates have been evaluated in children.

METHODS: A total of 4707 influenza vaccine-naive healthy children 6 to 72 months old were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive 2 doses of MF-59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Novartis Vaccines), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine subunit (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine control, GSK), or a saline placebo during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 influenza seasons. The second dose was given 30 days after dose 1. Clinical influenza-like illnesses cases identified by active surveillance were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza. Vaccine immunogenicity 50 days after dose 1 was evaluated in a subset of 777 children.

RESULTS: Immunogenicity and efficacy results for H3N2 were evaluated against the Prentice criteria, which confirmed that the immunogenicity results warranted estimation of an immunologic correlate. We then used the Dunning model fitting the H3N2 antibody titers at day 50 and the influenza cases observed in the immunogenicity subset to estimate a correlate of protection. This analysis revealed that a cutoff HI titer of 1:110 was associated with the conventional 50{\%} clinical protection rate against infection during the entire season, and titers of 1:215, 1:330, and 1:629 predicated protection rates of 70{\%}, 80{\%}, and 90{\%}, respectively. The conventional adult HI titer of 1:40 was only associated with 22{\%} protection.

CONCLUSIONS: The use of the 1:40 HI adult correlate of protection is not appropriate when evaluating influenza vaccines in children. Although a cutoff of 1:110 may be used to predict the conventional 50{\%} clinical protection rate, a titer of 1:330 would predict an 80{\%} protective level, which would seem to be more desirable from a public health perspective.},

abstract = {To gain insight into the age at which children become infected with influenza viruses for the first time, we analyzed the seroprevalence of antibodies against influenza viruses in children 0 to 7 years of age in the Netherlands. Serum samples were collected during a cross-sectional population-based study in 2006 and 2007 and were tested for the presence of antibodies against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses representative of viruses present in previous influenza seasons using the hemagglutination inhibition assay. The seroprevalence of antibodies to influenza virus was higher in children 1 to 6 months of age than in children 7 to 12 months of age, which likely reflects the presence of maternally derived antibodies. The proportion of study subjects {\textgreater}1 year of age with detectable antibodies against influenza viruses gradually increased with age until they reached the age of 6 years, when they all had antibodies to at least one influenza A virus. These findings may have implications for the development of vaccination strategies aiming at the protection of young children against seasonal and/or pandemic influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {Infection with seasonal influenza A viruses induces immunity to potentially pandemic influenza A viruses of other subtypes (heterosubtypic immunity). We recently demonstrated that vaccination against seasonal influenza prevented the induction of heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A/H5N1 virus induced by infection with seasonal influenza in animal models, which correlated with the absence of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. Annual vaccination of all healthy children against influenza has been recommended, but the impact of vaccination on the development of the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell immunity in children is currently unknown. Here we compared the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell immunity in children vaccinated annually with that in unvaccinated children. In the present study, we compared influenza A virus-specific cellular and humoral responses of unvaccinated healthy control children with those of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were vaccinated annually. Similar virus-specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody responses were observed, while an age-dependent increase of the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response that was absent in vaccinated CF children was observed in unvaccinated healthy control children. Our results indicate that annual influenza vaccination is effective against seasonal influenza but hampers the development of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the light of the development of protective immunity to seasonal and future pandemic influenza viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND As the epidemic of Zika virus expands in the Americas, countries across Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are becoming increasingly susceptible to the importation and possible local spread of the virus. To support public health readiness, we aim to identify regions and times where the potential health, economic, and social effects from Zika virus are greatest, focusing on resource-limited countries in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS Our model combined transportation network analysis, ecological modelling of mosquito occurrences, and vector competence for flavivirus transmission, using data from the International Air Transport Association, entomological observations from Zika's primary vector species, and climate conditions using WorldClim. We overlaid monthly flows of airline travellers arriving to Africa and the Asia-Pacific region from areas of the Americas suitable for year-round transmission of Zika virus with monthly maps of climatic suitability for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus within Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. FINDINGS An estimated 2{\textperiodcentered}6 billion people live in areas of Africa and the Asia-Pacific region where the presence of competent mosquito vectors and suitable climatic conditions could support local transmission of Zika virus. Countries with large volumes of travellers arriving from Zika virus-affected areas of the Americas and large populations at risk of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection include India (67 422 travellers arriving per year; 1{\textperiodcentered}2 billion residents in potential Zika transmission areas), China (238 415 travellers; 242 million residents), Indonesia (13 865 travellers; 197 million residents), Philippines (35 635 travellers; 70 million residents), and Thailand (29 241 travellers; 59 million residents).

abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a global threat causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Additionally, secondary bacterial infections, caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, are one of the main complications and responsible for the enhanced morbidity and mortality associated with IAV infections. In spite of the significant advances in our knowledge of IAV infections, holistic comprehension of the interplay between IAV and the host immune response (IR) remains largely fragmented. During the last decade, mathematical modeling has been instrumental to explain and quantify IAV dynamics. In this paper, we review not only the state of the art of mathematical models of IAV infection but also the methodologies exploited for parameter estimation. We focus on the adaptive IR control of IAV infection and the possible mechanisms that could promote a secondary bacterial coinfection. To exemplify IAV dynamics and identifiability issues, a mathematical model to explain the interactions between adaptive IR and IAV infection is considered. Furthermore, in this paper we propose a roadmap for future influenza research. The development of a mathematical modeling framework with a secondary bacterial coinfection, immunosenescence, host genetic factors and responsiveness to vaccination will be pivotal to advance IAV infection understanding and treatment optimization.},

abstract = {Background Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to neonatal microcephaly. To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses. Methods We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data. Results A total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82{\%}) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28{\%} had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58{\%} vs. 13{\%}, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40{\%} vs. 7{\%}, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58{\%}) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29{\%}) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed. Conclusions Despite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A Zika virus epidemic was registered in 2015 in Northeast Brazil. In the State of Pernambuco, thousands of classical cases transpired, and in the following months, neurological disturbances in adults and microcephaly in newborns emerged as complications. After the peak of the epidemic, the official system reported only four cases of Zika virus but over 100,000 cases of dengue virus. The vigilance system was unable to retrospectively estimate cases or to issue an alert to officially notified cases with possible inconsistence concerning specific arbovirosis diagnoses. METHODS: To evaluate the frequency of different arbovirosis diagnoses based on clinical-epidemiologic criteria, from January to April 2015, we conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzing suspected cases of arbovirosis. RESULTS: Of 1 , 046 total suspected cases of arbovirus, 895 (86{\%}) were classified as probable Zika virus cases, and 151 (14{\%}) as probable dengue virus cases. The most frequent manifestations in probable Zika virus cases were exanthema (100{\%}), pruritus (50.7{\%}), fever (20.4{\%}) and arthralgia (27.7{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the official data, during the peak months of the arbovirosis epidemic of 2015, most cases were compatible with Zika virus infections. Hospital-based studies, although retrospective and based on secondary data from clinical files, might provide a better estimate of the number of cases relative to currently available data, if derived from several urgent care units of representative areas of a city or state.This would partially retrospectively correct some inconsistences regarding official notifications.},

abstract = {Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016. We developed a climate-driven R0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two key mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature. It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 1950-2015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013. The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 2015-2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o climate phenomenon affecting the region. The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae. aegypti is abundant. Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season.},

abstract = {There currently is a severe Zika Virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil and other South American countries. Due to international travel, this poses severe public health risk of ZIKV importation to other countries. We estimate the prevalence of ZIKV in an import region by the time a microcephaly case is detected, since microcephaly is presently the most significant indication of ZIKV presence. We establish a mathematical model to describe ZIKV spread from a source region to an import region. This model incorporates both vector transmission (between humans and mosquitoes) and sexual transmission (from males to females). We take account of population structure through a contact network for sexually active individuals. Parameter values of our model are either taken from the literature or estimated from travel data. This model gives us the probability distribution of time until detection of the first microcephaly case. Based on current field observations, our results also indicate that the percentage of infected pregnant women that results in fetal abnormalities is more likely to be on the smaller end of the 1{\%}–30{\%} spectrum that is currently hypothesized. Our model predicts that for import regions with at least 250,000 people, on average 1,000–12,000 will have been infected by the time of the first detection of microcephaly, and on average 200–1,500 will be infectious at this time. Larger population sizes do not significantly change our predictions. By the first detection of a microcephaly case, a sizable fraction of the population will have been infected by ZIKV. It is thus clear that adequate surveillance, isolation, and quarantine are needed in susceptible import regions to stop the dissemination of a Zika epidemic.},

abstract = {Influenza continues to have a major worldwide impact, resulting in considerable human suffering and economic burden. The regular recurrence of influenza epidemics is thought to be caused by antigenic drift, and a number of studies have shown that sufficient changes can accumulate in the virus to allow influenza to reinfect the same host. To address this, influenza vaccine content is reviewed annually to ensure protection is maintained, despite the emergence of drift variants; however, it is not always possible to capture every significant drift, partly due to the timing of the recommendations. Vaccine mismatch can impact on vaccine effectiveness, and has significant epidemiological and economical consequences, as was seen most apparently in the 1997–1998 influenza season. To meet the challenge of antigenic drift, vaccines that confer broad protection against heterovariant strains are needed against seasonal, epidemic and pandemic influenza. In addition to the use of vaccine adjuvants, emerging research areas include development of a universal vaccine and the use of vaccines that exploit mechanisms of cross-protective immunity.},

abstract = {The increasing burden of dengue, and the relative failure of traditional vector control programs highlight the need to develop new control methods. SIT using self-limiting genetic technology is one such promising method. A self-limiting strain of Aedes aegypti, OX513A, has already reached the stage of field evaluation. Sustained releases of OX513A Ae. aegypti males led to 80{\%} suppression of a target wild Ae. aegypti population in the Cayman Islands in 2010. Here we describe sustained series of field releases of OX513A Ae. aegypti males in a suburb of Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil. This study spanned over a year and reduced the local Ae. aegypti population by 95{\%} (95{\%} CI: 92.2{\%}-97.5{\%}) based on adult trap data and 81{\%} (95{\%} CI: 74.9-85.2{\%}) based on ovitrap indices compared to the adjacent no-release control area. The mating competitiveness of the released males (0.031; 95{\%} CI: 0.025-0.036) was similar to that estimated in the Cayman trials (0.059; 95{\%} CI: 0.011-0.210), indicating that environmental and target-strain differences had little impact on the mating success of the OX513A males. We conclude that sustained release of OX513A males may be an effective and widely useful method for suppression of the key dengue vector Ae. aegypti. The observed level of suppression would likely be sufficient to prevent dengue epidemics in the locality tested and other areas with similar or lower transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly. On Feb 1, 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified. METHODS We retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk. FINDINGS The Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66{\%} (95{\%} CI 62–70) of the general population were infected. Of the eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88{\%}) occurred in the 4-month period March 1 to July 10, 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was two cases (95{\%} CI 0–8) per 10 000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34–191) per 10 000 women infected in the first trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the first trimester were not supported by the data. INTERPRETATION Our findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.

abstract = {Serological studies are the gold standard method to estimate influenza infection attack rates (ARs) in human populations. In a common protocol, blood samples are collected before and after the epidemic in a cohort of individuals; and a rise in haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers during the epidemic is considered as a marker of infection. Because of inherent measurement errors, a 2-fold rise is usually considered as insufficient evidence for infection and seroconversion is therefore typically defined as a 4-fold rise or more. Here, we revisit this widely accepted 70-year old criterion. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo data augmentation model to quantify measurement errors and reconstruct the distribution of latent true serological status in a Vietnamese 3-year serological cohort, in which replicate measurements were available. We estimate that the 1-sided probability of a 2-fold error is 9.3{\%} (95{\%} Credible Interval, CI: 3.3{\%}, 17.6{\%}) when antibody titer is below 10 but is 20.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 15.9{\%}, 24.0{\%}) otherwise. After correction for measurement errors, we find that the proportion of individuals with 2-fold rises in antibody titers was too large to be explained by measurement errors alone. Estimates of ARs vary greatly depending on whether those individuals are included in the definition of the infected population. A simulation study shows that our method is unbiased. The 4-fold rise case definition is relevant when aiming at a specific diagnostic for individual cases, but the justification is less obvious when the objective is to estimate ARs. In particular, it may lead to large underestimates of ARs. Determining which biological phenomenon contributes most to 2-fold rises in antibody titers is essential to assess bias with the traditional case definition and offer improved estimates of influenza ARs.},

abstract = {The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pandemic. Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates, their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20-29{\%} reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16-18{\%} of seasonal influenza cases (18-21{\%} in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13-17{\%} (18-23{\%} in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39-45{\%} (47-52{\%} in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period.},

abstract = {The differential antibody response measured by the commonly used hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays in patients with natural infection and vaccination has not been fully assessed. HI and conventional MN (CMN) assays were performed on sera from 651 patients with natural infection by pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus and on sera from 567 recipients of the corresponding vaccine. Surprisingly, the overall seroprotection rates determined by CMN and HI assays in vaccine recipients were only 44.8 and 35.1{\%}, respectively. Antibody titers measured by the CMN assay was significantly higher than that obtained by HI assay in vaccine recipients aged ≥50 years, but these titers were not significantly different among younger vaccine recipients. In contrast, the HI titer was greater than the CMN titer for the age group from 16 to 29 years but was not significantly different in other age groups for natural infection. Lower antibody levels were found in both naturally infected patients and immunized recipients in the older than in the younger age groups, but naturally infected patients exhibited higher HI and CMN titers than did the corresponding vaccine recipients. In addition, we developed a rapid fluorescent focus microneutralization (FFMN) assay to test sera from naturally infected patients. The FFMN assay has a better correlation with CMN than with HI ($\rho$ = 0.810 versus 0.684), which is expected of neutralizing antibody mainly targeted toward the inhibition of viral entry into cells. The higher antibody level elicited by natural infection than by vaccination may be related to differences between antigen presentation by the intramuscular route of vaccination and mucosal viral replication in mucosal cells of the respiratory tract.},

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study included patients admitted to hospital, subjects of a seroepidemiologic cohort study, and participants identified from outbreak studies in Singapore. Baseline (first available blood sample) and follow-up blood samples were analyzed for antibody titers to H1N1-2009 and recently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus micro-neutralization (VM) assays. 267 samples from 118 cases of H1N1-2009 were analyzed. Geometric mean titers by HI peaked at 123 (95{\%} confidence interval, CI 43-356) between days 30 to 39. The chance of observing seroconversion (four-fold or greater increase of antibodies) was maximized when restricting analysis to 45 participants with baseline sera collected within 5 days of onset and follow-up sera collected 15 or more days after onset; for these participants, 82{\%} and 89{\%} seroconverted to A/California/7/2009 H1N1 by HI and VM respectively. A four-fold or greater increase in cross-reactive antibody titers to seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 H1N1, A/Brisbane/10/2007 H3N2 and A/Wisconsin/15/2009 H3N2 occurred in 20{\%}, 18{\%} and 16{\%} of participants respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Appropriately timed paired serology detects 80-90{\%} RT-PCR confirmed H1N1-2009; Antibodies from infection with H1N1-2009 cross-reacted with seasonal influenza viruses.},

The recent emergence of Zika in Brazil and its association with an increased rate of congenital malformations has raised concerns over its impact on the birth rate in the country. Using data on the incidence of Zika in 2015–2016 and dengue in 2013 and 2015–2016 for the city of Rio de Janeiro (population 6.4 million), a massive increase of Zika in women compared to men was documented. 

METHODS
The age-adjusted incidence was compared between men and women. A negative binomial Poisson generalized linear model was fitted to the Zika incidence data to determine the significance of sexual transmission statistically. 

RESULTS
Even after correcting for the bias due to the systematic testing of pregnant women for Zika, there were found to be 90{\%} more registered cases per 100000 women than men in the sexually active age group (15–65 years); this was not the case for age groups {\textless}15 years and {\textgreater}65 years. Assuming that infected men transmit the disease to women in their semen, but that the converse is not true, some extra incidence in women is to be expected. An alternate hypothesis would be that women visit doctors more often than men. To test this, the incidence of dengue fever was compared in men and women in 2015 and in 2013 (before Zika reached Rio de Janeiro): in both years, women were 30{\%} more likely to be reported with dengue. 

CONCLUSION
Women in the sexually active age group are far more likely to get Zika than men (+90{\%} increase); sexual transmission is the most probable cause.

abstract = {This article describes a method for choosing observation times for stochastic processes to maximise the expected information about their parameters. Two commonly used models for epidemiological processes are considered: a simple death process and a susceptible-infected (SI) epidemic process with dual sources for infection spreading within and from outwith the population. The search for the optimal design uses Bayesian computational methods to explore the joint parameter-data-design space, combined with a method known as moment closure to approximate the likelihood to make the acceptance step efficient. For the processes considered, a small number of optimally chosen observations are shown to yield almost as much information as much more intensively observed schemes that are commonly used in epidemiological experiments. Analysis of the simple death process allows a comparison between the full Bayesian approach and locally optimal designs around a point estimate from the prior based on asymptotic results. The robustness of the approach to misspecified priors is demonstrated for the SI epidemic process, for which the computational intractability of the likelihood precludes locally optimal designs. We show that optimal designs derived by the Bayesian approach are similar for observational studies of a single epidemic and for studies involving replicated epidemics in independent subpopulations. Different optima result, however, when the objective is to maximise the gain in information based on informative and non-informative priors: this has implications when an experiment is designed to convince a na{\"{i}}ve or sceptical observer rather than consolidate the belief of an informed observer. Some extensions to the methods, including the selection of information criteria and extension to other epidemic processes with transition probabilities, are briefly addressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND  Usually, immunoglobulin M (IgM) serologic analysis is not sufficiently specific to confirm Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. However, since IgM does not cross the placenta, it may be a good marker of infection in neonates. METHODS  We tested blood from 42 mothers and neonates with microcephaly and collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 30 neonates. Molecular assays were performed for detection of ZIKV, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus; IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) were performed to detect ZIKV and dengue virus. No control neonates without microcephaly were evaluated. RESULTS  Among neonates, all 42 tested positive for ZIKV IgM: 38 of 42 serum specimens (90.5{\%}) were positive, whereas 30 of 30 CSF specimens (100{\%}) were positive. ZIKV IgM-specific ELISA ratios, calculated as the mean optical density (OD) of the test sample when reacted on viral antigen divided by the mean OD of the negative control when reacted with viral antigen, were higher in CSF specimens (median, 14.9 [range, 9.3-16.4]) than in serum (median, 8.9 [range, 2.1-20.6]; P = .0003). All ZIKV IgM-positive results among the neonates were confirmed by the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Mother/neonate pairs with primary ZIKV infection had neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV only, and mother/neonate pairs with ZIKV virus infection secondary to infection with another flavivirus had high titers of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV. Among secondary infections, median titers in serum were 2072 (range, 232-12 980) for mothers and 2730 (range, 398-12 980) for neonates (P {\textless} .0001), and the median titer in CSF was 93 (range, 40-578) among neonates (P {\textless} .0001). CONCLUSIONS  Among neonates, detection of ZIKV IgM in serum is confirmatory of congenital ZIKV infection, and detection of ZIKV IgM in CSF is confirmatory of neurologic infection. Therefore, we recommend testing for ZIKV IgM in neonates suspected of having congenital ZIKV infection and performance of PRNTs in equivocal cases.},

The regulatory authorities currently annually license vaccines based on serum antibodies directed toward the major surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA). The most commonly used serological test, the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay utilizes red blood cells, which show considerable biological variation. There is a need for validated, standardized assays to reduce laboratory variation steps that are currently being taken by the regulatory agencies. Here we examine the historical evidence for defining the HI titer ≥ 40 as a surrogate correlate of protection and examine alternative assays. Moreover, the immune response to influenza is multifacated and there are probably multiple correlates of protection.

abstract = {BACKGROUND As of 1997, less than one-third of developing countries included rubella vaccine in their national immunization programme. In countries that have achieved high coverage of measles vaccine, an ideal opportunity exists to include control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in enhanced measles control activities. Data on the burden of congenital rubella syndrome are important to guide rubella vaccination policies. METHODS We reviewed the literature to identify studies of rubella antibody prevalence in developing countries that were conducted on populations with no major selection bias, prior to wide-scale rubella vaccination in the country. We used a simple catalytic model to describe the age-specific prevalence of susceptibility to rubella virus infection in given populations. Estimates of the incidence of infection among pregnant women were calculated using expressions for the average prevalence of susceptibility to infection and the incidence of infection during gestation. To estimate the number of cases of CRS, we assumed an overall risk of 65{\%} after infection in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy and zero risk thereafter. These estimates were derived for each country for which data were available, then for each World Health Organization region, excluding Europe. RESULTS The estimated mean incidence of CRS per 100,000 live births was lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (77.4, range 0-212) and highest in the Americas (175, range 0-598). The mean of the estimates of the total number of cases of CRS in developing countries in 1996 was approximately 110,000. The range was, however, very wide, from as few as 14,000 to as many as 308,000 cases. CONCLUSIONS Congenital rubella syndrome is an under-recognized public health problem in many developing countries. There is an urgent need for collection of appropriate data to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a potential global rubella control programme. Inclusion of rubella vaccine in the national immunization program was found to be implemented in less than one-third of the developing countries in a review conducted by WHO. This paper examines the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) cases in developing countries using published rubella infection prevalence. Documented literature of previous studies and medical data on women attending antenatal clinics were gathered and rubella antibody prevalence was identified before the wide-scale rubella vaccination. A catalytic model was used in describing age-specific prevalence of rubella virus infection in given populations, while expressions for the average prevalence of susceptibility to infection and incidence of infection during gestation was used to estimate the incidence of infection among pregnant women. Using the data gathered from each country and WHO regions, an overall risk of 65{\%} after infection in the first 16 weeks and zero risk of defect later in pregnancy was assumed to estimate the incidence of CRS. Results revealed that the estimated mean incidence of CRS per 100,000 live births was significantly lower in the eastern Mediterranean region (77.4, range 0-212) and higher in the Americas (175, range 0-598). On the other hand, the 1996 CRS mean estimate for developing countries was approximately 110,000, ranging from 14,000 to 308,000 cases. This study concludes with the stated need for an improved CRS program in developing countries as well as adequate data collection necessary for cost-effectiveness evaluation of potential global rubella control programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy. METHODS We did this case-control study in eight public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with microcephaly. Two controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fluid samples of cases were tested for Zika virus-specific IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy was defined as detection of Zika virus-specific IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} CIs using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities. FINDINGS Between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80{\%}) of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64{\%}) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0{\textperiodcentered}12). 13 (41{\%}) of 32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55{\textperiodcentered}5 (95{\%} CI 8{\textperiodcentered}6–∞); OR 113{\textperiodcentered}3 (95{\%} CI 14{\textperiodcentered}5–∞) for seven cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24{\textperiodcentered}7 (95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}9–∞) for four cases without brain abnormalities. INTERPRETATION Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confirm the strength of association in a larger sample size.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A Zika virus epidemic was registered in 2015 in Northeast Brazil. In the State of Pernambuco, thousands of classical cases transpired, and in the following months, neurological disturbances in adults and microcephaly in newborns emerged as complications. After the peak of the epidemic, the official system reported only four cases of Zika virus but over 100,000 cases of dengue virus. The vigilance system was unable to retrospectively estimate cases or to issue an alert to officially notified cases with possible inconsistence concerning specific arbovirosis diagnoses. METHODS: To evaluate the frequency of different arbovirosis diagnoses based on clinical-epidemiologic criteria, from January to April 2015, we conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzing suspected cases of arbovirosis. RESULTS: Of 1 , 046 total suspected cases of arbovirus, 895 (86{\%}) were classified as probable Zika virus cases, and 151 (14{\%}) as probable dengue virus cases. The most frequent manifestations in probable Zika virus cases were exanthema (100{\%}), pruritus (50.7{\%}), fever (20.4{\%}) and arthralgia (27.7{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the official data, during the peak months of the arbovirosis epidemic of 2015, most cases were compatible with Zika virus infections. Hospital-based studies, although retrospective and based on secondary data from clinical files, might provide a better estimate of the number of cases relative to currently available data, if derived from several urgent care units of representative areas of a city or state.This would partially retrospectively correct some inconsistences regarding official notifications.},

abstract = {Introduction: Since the end of 2014, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been rapidly spreading in Brazil.   Methodology: To analyze the possible association of yellow fever vaccine with a protective effect against ZIKV-related microcephaly, the following spatial analyses were performed, using Brazilian municipalities as units: i) yellow fever vaccination coverage in Brazilian municipalities in individuals aged 15-49; ii) reported cases of microcephaly by municipality; and iii) confirmed cases of microcephaly related to ZIKV, by municipality. SaTScan software was used to identify clusters of municipalities for high risk of microcephaly.   Results: There were seven significant high risk clusters of confirmed microcephaly cases, with four of them located in the Northeast where yellow fever vaccination rates were the lowest. The clusters harbored only 2.9{\%} of the total population of Brazil, but 15.2{\%} of confirmed cases of microcephaly.   Conclusion: We hypothesize that pregnant women in regions with high yellow fever vaccination coverage may pose their offspring to lower risk for development of microcephaly. There is an urgent need for systematic studies to confirm the possible link between low yellow fever vaccination coverage, Zika virus infection and microcephaly.},

abstract = {The success of influenza vaccination depends largely on the antigenic match between the influenza vaccine strains and the virus strains actually circulating during the season. In the past, this match has proved to be satisfactory in most seasons. In the 1997/1998 season, however, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays with ferret antisera indicated a considerable mismatch between the H3N2 vaccine component and the most prevalent epidemic influenza A(H3N2) virus. The results from antigenic analyses using pre- and postvaccination serum samples from volunteers of various ages, including residents of nursing homes who were more than 60 years of age, were in good agreement with the results obtained with ferret antisera. Homologous serum antibody responses to the H3N2 vaccine component as well as the cross-reactivity of the induced antibodies to the epidemic H3N2 strain, declined with increasing age of the vaccinees. As a consequence of these two effects, 84{\%} of the vaccinees over 75 years of age did not develop HI antibody titers {\textgreater}/= 40 against the major H3N2 virus variant of 1997/1998, suggesting that they were not protected against infection with this virus variant. These findings support the current policy of the World Health Organization (WHO), which is to base worldwide influenza virus surveillance on results predominantly obtained by antigenic analyses of influenza virus isolates with ferret antisera in HI tests. If an antigenic mismatch is observed, the protective efficacy of the vaccine, especially for the elderly, may be insufficient. The observations also support the current policy to include the elderly in serologic efficacy trials.},

HI titres against the tested seasonal and pandemic strains were determined using the HI technique. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) were estimated using regression models for interval-censored data. Generalized additive mixed models were fit to log-transformed HI estimates to study the relationship between HI titre and age (age at inclusion and/or age at initial strain circulation). GMT against one strain was consistently highest in the birth cohort exposed to that strain during childhood, with peak titres observed in subjects aged 7–8 years at the time of initial strain circulation. Our results complete previous findings on influenza A(H3N2) strains and identify a strain-dependent relationship between HI titre and age at initial strain circulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Studying the spread of influenza in human populations and protection by influenza vaccines provides important insights into immunity against influenza. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic has taught the most recent lessons. Neutralizing and receptor-blocking antibodies against hemagglutinin are the primary means of protection from the spread of pandemic and seasonal strains. Anti-neuraminidase antibodies seem to play a secondary role. More broadly cross-reactive forms of immunity may lessen disease severity but are insufficient to prevent epidemic spread. Priming by prior exposure to related influenza strains through infection or immunization permits rapid, potent antibody responses to immunization. Priming is of greater importance to the design of immunization strategies than the immunologically fascinating phenomenon of dominant recall responses to previously encountered strains (original antigenic sin). Comparisons between non-adjuvanted inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines demonstrate that both can protect, with some advantage of live attenuated vaccines in children and some advantage of inactivated vaccines in those with multiple prior exposures to influenza antigens. The addition of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants to inactivated vaccines provides enhanced functional antibody titers, greater breadth of antibody cross-reactivity, and antigen dose sparing. The MF59 adjuvant broadens the distribution of B-cell epitopes recognized on HA and NA following immunization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Women who acquire toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy (in most cases detected through serological screening) require counselling about the risk of congenital infection and its clinical sequelae. Reliable estimates of risk are not currently available. We undertook an analysis of data from women referred to the toxoplasmosis reference laboratory, Lyon, France, between 1987 and 1995. METHODS Information was collected from clinical notes kept at the laboratory and, where necessary, from the relevant obstetrician or paediatrician via telephone. Methods were developed to derive estimates of the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis by exact duration of gestation at maternal seroconversion. FINDINGS We analysed obstetric and paediatric data on 603 confirmed maternal toxoplasmosis infections. At least 564 women received antiparasitic drugs according to a standard protocol. Congenital infection status was ascertained in 554 cases, and infected children were followed-up for a median of 54 months. The overall maternal-fetal transmission rate was 29{\%} (95{\%} CI 25-33), which masked a sharp increase in risk with duration of gestation from 6{\%} at 13 weeks to 72{\%} at 36 weeks. However, fetuses infected in early pregnancy were much more likely to show clinical signs of infection. These effects counterbalance, and women who seroconverted at 24-30 weeks of gestation carried the highest risk (10{\%}) of having a congenitally infected child with early clinical signs who was thus at risk of long-term complications. INTERPRETATION This information will assist the clinical counselling of pregnant women diagnosed with acute toxoplasmosis and may guide individual decisions on investigative and therapeutic options. Further studies are required to determine the long-term risks of clinical symptoms and disability due to congenital toxoplasmosis.},

abstract = {The emergence of pandemic influenza viruses poses a major public
health threat. Therefore, there is a need for a vaccine that can
induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies that protect against
seasonal as well as pandemic influenza strains. Human broadly
neutralizing antibodies directed against highly conserved
epitopes in the stem region of influenza virus HA have been
recently characterized. However, it remains unknown what the
baseline levels are of antibodies and memory B cells that are
directed against these conserved epitopes. More importantly, it
is also not known to what extent anti-HA stem B-cell responses
get boosted in humans after seasonal influenza vaccination. In
this study, we have addressed these two outstanding questions.
Our data show that: (i) antibodies and memory B cells directed
against the conserved HA stem region are prevalent in humans, but
their levels are much lower than B-cell responses directed to
variable epitopes in the HA head; (ii) current seasonal influenza
vaccines are efficient in inducing B-cell responses to the
variable HA head region but they fail to boost responses to the
conserved HA stem region; and (iii) in striking contrast,
immunization of humans with the avian influenza virus H5N1
induced broadly cross-reactive HA stem-specific antibodies. Taken
together, our findings provide a potential vaccination strategy
where heterologous influenza immunization could be used for
increasing the levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies and for
priming the human population to respond quickly to emerging
pandemic influenza threats.},

abstract = {Importance Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and it has been associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Objective To estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico and the number of associated congenital microcephaly cases. Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a modeling study from April to July 2016. Using parameters derived from published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. We used uncertainty distributions to reflect the limited information available for parameter values. Given the high level of uncertainty in model parameters, interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as primary results. Outcomes were modeled for pregnant women in Puerto Rico, which currently has more confirmed ZIKV cases than any other US location. Exposure Zika virus infection in pregnant women. Main Outcomes and Measures Number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and number of congenital microcephaly cases. Results We estimated an IQR of 5900 to 10 300 pregnant women (median, 7800) might be infected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico. Of these, an IQR of 100 to 270 infants (median, 180) may be born with microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infection from mid-2016 to mid-2017. In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 cases (median, 12) of congenital microcephaly are expected in Puerto Rico per year. Conclusions and Relevance The estimate of 5900 to 10 300 pregnant women that might be infected with ZIKV provides an estimate for the number of infants that could potentially have ZIKV-associated adverse outcomes. Including baseline cases of microcephaly, we estimated that an IQR of 110 to 290 total cases of congenital microcephaly, mostly attributable to ZIKV infection, could occur from mid-2016 to mid-2017 in the absence of effective interventions. The primary limitation in this analysis is uncertainty in model parameters. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the cumulative incidence of ZIKV infection and risk of microcephaly given maternal infection in the first trimester were the primary drivers of both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of microcephaly cases. Increased information on these parameters would lead to more precise estimates. Nonetheless, the results underscore the need for urgent actions being undertaken in Puerto Rico to prevent congenital ZIKV infection and prepare for affected infants.},

abstract = {During a pandemic, influenza vaccines that rely on neutralizing antibodies to protect against matched viruses might not be available early enough. Much broader (heterosubtypic) immune protection is seen in animals. Do humans also have cross-subtype immunity? To investigate this issue, archival records from the Cleveland Family Study, which was conducted before and during the 1957 pandemic (during which a shift from subtype H1N1 to H2N2 occurred), were analyzed. Only 5.6{\%} of the adults who had had symptomatic influenza A in earlier study years developed influenza during the pandemic, despite living in households with participants who had influenza. In contrast, 55.2{\%} of the children who had had symptomatic influenza A contracted it again. These findings suggest an impact of accumulated heterosubtypic immunity during a pandemic. Such immunity, as well as its implications for vaccination, should be further investigated.},

abstract = {Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with {\~{}}30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015 and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in November 2015. Using next generation sequencing we generated seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes, sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, estimated to have occurred between May-Dec 2013, more than 12 months prior to the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV endemic areas, and with reported outbreaks in Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology in the Americas of this emerging virus.},

observed decreasing VE with increasing time since vaccination for

Conclusions: We observed decreasing influenza vaccine protection

types/subtypes. This association is consistent with intraseason
waning of host immunity, but bias or residual confounding could
explain these findings.},

@article{Fisher2012-ck,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the emergence of H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1)
influenza, the CDC recommended that pregnant women be one of five
initial target groups to receive the 2009 monovalent H1N1
vaccine, regardless of prior infection with this influenza
strain. We sought to compare the immune response of pregnant
women to H1N1 infection versus vaccination and to determine the
extent of passive immunity conferred to the newborn.
METHODS/FINDINGS: During the 2009-2010 influenza season, we
enrolled a cohort of women who either had confirmed pH1N1
infection during pregnancy, did not have pH1N1 during pregnancy
but were vaccinated against pH1N1, or did not have illness or
vaccination. Maternal and umbilical cord venous blood samples
were collected at delivery. Hemagglutination inhibition assays
(HAI) for pH1N1 were performed. Data were analyzed using linear
regression analyses. HAIs were performed for matched
maternal/cord blood pairs for 16 women with confirmed pH1N1
infection, 14 women vaccinated against pH1N1, and 10 women
without infection or vaccination. We found that pH1N1 vaccination
and wild-type infection during pregnancy did not differ with
respect to (1) HAI titers at delivery, (2) HAI antibody decay
slopes over time, and (3) HAI titers in the cord blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against pH1N1 confers a similar HAI
antibody response as compared to pH1N1 infection during
pregnancy, both in quantity and quality. Illness or vaccination
during pregnancy confers passive immunity to the newborn.},

landscapes to study immune profiles covering 43 years of
influenza A/H3N2 virus evolution for 69 individuals monitored for
infection over 6 years and for 225 individuals pre- and
postvaccination. Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased
broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the
extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We
explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of
an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing
antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters.
These results indicate that preemptive vaccine updates may
improve influenza vaccine efficacy in previously exposed
individuals.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution, genetic diversity, broad host range, and increasing human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses highlight the need for an efficacious cross-clade vaccine. Using the ferret model, we compared induction of cross-reactive immunity and protective efficacy of three single-clade H5N1 vaccines and a novel multiple-clade H5N1 vaccine, with and without MF59 adjuvant. Reverse genetics (rg) was used to generate vaccine viruses containing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes of wild-type H5N1 viruses. Ferrets received two doses of inactivated whole-virus vaccine separated by 3 weeks. Single-clade vaccines (7.5 microg HA per dose) included rg-A/Vietnam/1203/04 (clade 1), rg-A/Hong Kong/213/03 (clade 1), and rg-A/Japanese White Eye/Hong Kong/1038/06 (clade 2.3). The multiple-clade vaccine contained 3.75 microg HA per dose of each single-clade vaccine and of rg-A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/244/05 (clade 2.2). Two doses of vaccine were required to substantially increase anti-HA and virus neutralizing antibody titers to H5N1 viruses. MF59 adjuvant enhanced induction of clade-specific and cross-clade serum antibody responses, reduced frequency of infection (as determined by upper respiratory tract virus shedding and seroconversion data), and eliminated disease signs. The rg-A/Hong Kong/213/03 vaccine induced the highest antibody titers to homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses, while rg-A/Japanese White Eye/Hong Kong/1038/06 vaccine induced the lowest. The multiple-clade vaccine was broadly immunogenic against clade 1 and 2 viruses. The rg-A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine (the currently stockpiled H5N1 vaccine) most effectively reduced upper respiratory tract virus shedding after challenge with clade 1 and 2 viruses. Importantly, all vaccines protected against lethal challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus and provided cross-clade protection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
In November, 2015, an epidemic of microcephaly was reported in Brazil, which was later attributed to congenital Zika virus infection. 7830 suspected cases had been reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health by June 4, 2016, but little is known about their characteristics. We aimed to describe these newborn babies in terms of clinical findings, anthropometry, and survival. 

METHODS
We reviewed all 1501 liveborn infants for whom investigation by medical teams at State level had been completed as of Feb 27, 2016, and classified suspected cases into five categories based on neuroimaging and laboratory results for Zika virus and other relevant infections. Definite cases had laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection; highly probable cases presented specific neuroimaging findings, and negative laboratory results for other congenital infections; moderately probable cases had specific imaging findings but other infections could not be ruled out; somewhat probable cases had imaging findings, but these were not reported in detail by the local teams; all other newborn babies were classified as discarded cases. Head circumference by gestational age was assessed with InterGrowth standards. First week mortality and history of rash were provided by the State medical teams. 

FINDINGS
Between Nov 19, 2015, and Feb 27, 2015, investigations were completed for 1501 suspected cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, of whom 899 were discarded. Of the remainder 602 cases, 76 were definite, 54 highly probable, 181 moderately probable, and 291 somewhat probable of congenital Zika virus syndrome. Clinical, anthropometric, and survival differences were small among the four groups. Compared with these four groups, the 899 discarded cases had larger head circumferences (mean Z scores −1{\textperiodcentered}54 vs −3{\textperiodcentered}13, difference 1{\textperiodcentered}58 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}45–1{\textperiodcentered}72]); lower first-week mortality (14 per 1000 vs 51 per 1000; rate ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}28 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}14–0{\textperiodcentered}56]); and were less likely to have a history of rash during pregnancy (20{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} vs 61{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}, ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}34 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}27–0{\textperiodcentered}42]). Rashes in the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with brain abnormalities despite normal sized heads. One in five definite or probable cases presented head circumferences in the normal range (above −2 SD below the median of the InterGrowth standard) and for one third of definite and probable cases there was no history of a rash during pregnancy. The peak of the epidemic occurred in late November, 2015. 

INTERPRETATION
Zika virus congenital syndrome is a new teratogenic disease. Because many definite or probable cases present normal head circumference values and their mothers do not report having a rash, screening criteria must be revised in order to detect all affected newborn babies.

abstract = {The frequency and consequences of reinfection with influenza A virus were studied by longitudinal observation of families for a three-year period in which two epidemics of influenza A (H3N2) occurred. Seven children followed from birth were reinfected 10-25 months after their first infection. Two children were reinfected by the same H3N2 virus while the others were reinfected with a closely related variant. At least five of these reinfections were accompanied by respiratory illness. Reinfection illness was similar to that accompanying primary infection. For children in the second and third year of life during the 1978 epidemic, the rate of infection was the same for those who had been previously infected (seven of 12) as for those who had not been previously infected (22 of 40). Reinfection was detected in 26{\%} of older siblings and 6{\%} of parents. The occurrence of reinfection may have important implications for elucidation of the protective immune response and for development of prophylaxis for influenzal infections.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify general properties of emerging infectious agents that determine the likely success of two simple public health measures in controlling outbreaks, namely (i) isolating symptomatic individuals and (ii) tracing and quarantining their contacts. Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R(0)). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Most influenza virus infections are associated with mild disease. One approach to estimate the occurrence of influenza virus infections in individuals is via repeated measurement of humoral antibody titres. We used baseline and convalescent antibody titres measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and viral neutralization (VN) assays against influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses to investigate the characteristics of antibody rises following virologically confirmed influenza virus infections in participants in a community-based study. Multivariate models were fitted in a Bayesian framework to characterize the distribution of changes in antibody titres following influenza A virus infections. In 122 participants with PCR-confirmed influenza A virus infection, homologous antibody titres rose by geometric means of 1{\textperiodcentered}2- to 10{\textperiodcentered}2-fold after infection with A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09. Significant cross-reactions were observed between A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal A(H1N1). Antibody titre rises for some subtypes and assays varied by age, receipt of oseltamivir treatment, and recent receipt of influenza vaccination. In conclusion, we provided a quantitative description of the mean and variation in rises in influenza virus antibody titres following influenza virus infection. The multivariate patterns in boosting of antibody titres following influenza virus infection could be taken into account to improve estimates of cumulative incidence of infection in seroepidemiological studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a {\$}\beta{\$}-herpesvirus present in a
latent form in most people worldwide. In immunosuppressed
individuals, CMV can reactivate and cause serious clinical
complications, but the effect of the latent state on healthy
people remains elusive. We undertook a systems approach to
understand the differences between seropositive and negative
subjects and measured hundreds of immune system components from
blood samples including cytokines and chemokines, immune cell
phenotyping, gene expression, ex vivo cell responses to cytokine
stimuli, and the antibody response to seasonal influenza
vaccination. As expected, we found decreased responses to
vaccination and an overall down-regulation of immune components
in aged individuals regardless of CMV status. In contrast,
CMV-seropositive young adults exhibited enhanced antibody
responses to influenza vaccination, increased CD8(+) T cell
sensitivity, and elevated levels of circulating
interferon-{\$}\gamma{\$} compared to seronegative individuals.
Experiments with young mice infected with murine CMV also showed
significant protection from an influenza virus challenge compared
with uninfected animals, although this effect declined with time.
These data show that CMV and its murine equivalent can have a
beneficial effect on the immune response of young, healthy
individuals, which may explain the ubiquity of CMV infection in
humans and many other species.},

abstract = {Proactive priming before the next pandemic could induce immune memory responses to novel influenza antigens. In an open-label study, we analyzed B cell memory and antibody responses of 54 adults who received 2 7.5-microg doses of MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 clade 1 (H5N1) vaccine. Twenty-four subjects had been previously primed with MF59-adjuvanted or plain clade 0-like A/duck/Singapore/1997 (H5N3) vaccine during 1999-2001. The prevaccination frequency of circulating memory B cells reactive to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was low in both primed and unprimed individuals. However, at day 21 after boosting, MF59-adjuvanted primed subjects displayed a higher frequency of H5N1-specific memory B cells than plain-primed or unprimed subjects. The immune memory was rapidly mobilized by a single vaccine administration and resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies to antigenically diverse clade 0, 1, and 2 H5N1 viruses already at day 7. In general, postvaccination antibody titers were significantly higher in primed subjects than in unprimed subjects. Subjects primed with MF59-adjuvanted vaccine responded significantly better than those primed with plain vaccine, most notably in early induction and duration of cross-reacting antibody responses. After 6 months, high titers of cross-reactive antibody remained detectable among MF59-primed subjects. We conclude that distant priming with clade 0-like H5N3 induces a pool of cross-reactive memory B cells that can be boosted rapidly years afterward by a mismatched MF59-adjuvanted vaccine to generate high titers of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies rapidly. These results suggest that pre-pandemic vaccination strategies should be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is increasingly clear that influenza A infection induces cross-subtype neutralizing antibodies that may potentially confer protection against zoonotic infections. It is unclear whether this is mediated by antibodies to the neuraminidase (NA) or haemagglutinin (HA). We use pseudoviral particles (H5pp) coated with H5 haemagglutinin but not N1 neuraminidase to address this question. In this study, we investigate whether cross-neutralizing antibodies in persons unexposed to H5N1 is reactive to the H5 haemagglutinin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured H5-neutralization antibody titers pre- and post-vaccination using the H5N1 micro-neutralization test (MN) and H5pp tests in subjects given seasonal vaccines and in selected sera from European elderly volunteers in a H5N1 vaccine trial who had detectable pre-vaccination H5N1 MN antibody titers. We found detectable (titer {\textgreater} or = 20) H5N1 neutralizing antibodies in a minority of pre-seasonal vaccine sera and evidence of a serological response to H5N1 in others after seasonal influenza vaccination. There was excellent correlation in the antibody titers between the H5N1 MN and H5pp tests. Similar correlations were found between MN and H5pp in the pre-vaccine sera from the cohort of H5N1 vaccine trial recipients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Heterosubtype neutralizing antibody to H5N1 in healthy volunteers unexposed to H5N1 is mediated by cross-reaction to the H5 haemagglutinin.},

abstract = {Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917-1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R(0) {\textless} 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to {\textless}10{\%} of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

abstract = {The population dynamics of infectious disease is a mature field in terms of theory and to some extent, application. However for microparasites, the theory and application of models of the dynamics within a single infected host is still an open field. Further, connecting across the scales – from cellular to host level, to population level – has potential to vastly improve our understanding of pathogen dynamics and evolution. Here, we highlight seven challenges in the following areas: transmission bottlenecks, heterogeneity within host, dynamic fitness landscapes within hosts, making use of next-generation sequencing data, capturing superinfection and when and how to model more than two scales.},
annote = {- Focus on pathogen dynamics and evolution.
- Firstly - how does infectiousness depend on pathogen load? Mammalian transmission experiments. Functoinal relationship between transmissoin route and pathogen load.
- Recipient host. Interaction of infectious particles - transmission bottleneck.

- Host heterogeneity. Do we need to consider cellular dynamics or celular populations? In some cases, yes, though to capture all of the real compartments is infeasible.

- Fitness landscapes - map genotype to phenotype. Either replication or transmission.

- Deep sequencing data. Genetic variation of pathogens within infected hosts.

- Superinfection - cite example of HIV.

- When to use different scales - within-host multi scale models less common because little is measured in vivo. Need to synthesise processes to understand whether simple representations are accurate enough.},

METHODS Thirty-seven subjects previously vaccinated with a baculovirus-expressed recombinant hemagglutinin A/Hong Kong/156/1997 vaccine in 1998 received a single intramuscular dose of 90 microg of inactivated subvirion A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine in 2006. Serum antibody was measured before vaccination and 28 and 56 days after vaccination. Antibody responses were compared with those measured after one or two 90-microg doses in H5-naive subjects. RESULTS On day 28 after a single dose, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of hemagglutination-inhibition antibody in primed subjects was 64.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 37.8-108.5), with 68{\%} responding (4-fold increase in antibody level to a titer of {\textgreater}or=1:40). In contrast, H5-naive subjects who received two 90-microg doses had a day 56 (28 days after the second dose) GMT of 27.7 (95{\%} CI, 20.3-38.0), with only 43{\%} responding.

abstract = {Three outbreaks of influenza caused by influenza A H1N1 occurred in a boys' boarding school in 1978, 1979 and 1983. The serological response to infection with variants of the H1N1 virus was studied by radial haemolysis and haemagglutination inhibition after primary infection and reinfection. The persistence of this antibody was also studied. Infection in 1978 resulted in the production of persistent antibody to both the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the homotypic strain. Antibody which cross-reacted with later variants of the virus was less frequently produced, the peak response was delayed and such antibody persisted less well. Infection in 1979 resulted in a similar response to that observed in 1978 after primary infection. Reinfection resulted in a broad response in all cases. In 1983 all infected boys produced antibody which reacted with the homotypic strain but only approximately one-third of primary infections produced antibody which reacted with the A/USSR/92/77 strain. The neuraminidase of the A/USSR strain failed to detect one third of the primary infections. Reinfection again resulted in a broad response.},

abstract = {The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay has been the main method used to investigate immune responses to vaccination against influenza H1N1 (2009) virus. However microneutralization tests (MNT) have been shown to be more sensitive and more specific. In this study, the three methods of choice: (i) the HI assay, (ii) an ELISA-based conventional MNT and (iii) a colorimetric MNT in terms of their ability to detect antibody responses in serum pairs collected from 43 healthy individuals before and 21 days after vaccination were compared. The colorimetric MNT was established yielding intra- and inter-run imprecisions of 7.5{\%} and 12.4{\%}, respectively. Testing of antisera to seasonal influenza viruses demonstrated the assay to be specific for antibodies to influenza H1N1 (2009) virus. A good correlation between the three methods was found, being highest for the ELISA-MNT and the colorimetric MNT (r=0.714 for geometric mean titers (GMT) and r=0.695 for titer increases). Similar rates of fourfold titer increases were detected: 95.3{\%} in the ELISA-MNT vs. 93.0{\%} in colorimetric MNT and 95.3{\%} in HI assay. The ELISA-based MNT demonstrated the highest titer range leading to the highest postvaccination GMT and the highest titer increase ({\textgreater}50-fold). The lowest GMTs were measured with the HI assay, while the colorimetric MNT detected the highest GMT in prevaccination sera. Taken together, similar seroconversion rates were obtained with the three assays. The ELISA-MNT appeared to be the best method to compare absolute pre- and postvaccination GMTs. The colorimetric MNT, being less labour-intensive than the ELISA-MNT, seems to be a suitable tool in vaccination studies.},

abstract = {Adjuvants have been used to augment the immune response in
experimental immunology as well as in practical vaccination for
more than 60 years. The chemical nature of adjuvants, their mode
of action and the profile of their side effects are highly
variable. Some of the side effects can be ascribed to an
unintentional stimulation of different mechanisms of the immune
system whereas others may reflect general adverse pharmacological
reactions. The most common adjuvants for human use today are
still aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate and calcium
phosphate although oil emulsions, products from bacteria and
their synthetic derivatives as well as liposomes have also been
tested or used in humans. In recent years monophosphoryl lipid A,
ISCOMs with Quil-A and Syntex adjuvant formulation (SAF)
containing the threonyl derivative of muramyl dipeptide have been
under consideration for use as adjuvants in humans. At present
the choice of adjuvants for human vaccination reflects a
compromise between a requirement for adjuvanticity and an
acceptable low level of side effects.},

abstract = {Today, dengue viruses are the most prevalent arthropod-borne viruses in the world. Since the 1960s, numerous reports have identified a second heterologous dengue virus (DENV) infection as a principal risk factor for severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS). Modifiers of dengue disease response include the specific sequence of two DENV infections, the interval between infections, and contributions from the human host, such as age, ethnicity, chronic illnesses and genetic background. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection has been proposed as the early mechanism underlying DHF/DSS. Dengue cross-reactive antibodies raised following a first dengue infection combine with a second infecting virus to form infectious immune complexes that enter Fc-receptor-bearing cells. This results in an increased number of infected cells and increased viral output per cell. At the late illness stage, high levels of cytokines, possibly the result of T cell elimination of infected cells, result in vascular permeability, leading to shock and death. This review is focused on the etiological role of secondary infections (SI) and mechanisms of ADE.},

Besides implementing hygiene measures to limit further camel-to-human and human-to-human transmissions, vaccine-mediated reduction of MERS-CoV spread from the animal reservoir may be envisaged. Here, we show that a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein confers mucosal immunity in dromedary camels. Significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts was observed in vaccinated animals upon MERS-CoV challenge as compared to controls. Protection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. Induction of MVA-specific antibodies that cross-neutralize camelpox virus, would also provide protection against camelpox.},

abstract = {Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with approximately 8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.},

To assess the level of preexisting immunity in humans and to evaluate seasonal vaccine strategies, we measured the antibody response to the pandemic virus resulting from previous influenza infection or vaccination in different age groups. METHODS: Using a microneutralization assay, we measured cross-reactive antibodies to pandemic H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) in stored serum samples from persons who either donated blood or were vaccinated with recent seasonal or 1976 swine influenza vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 4 of 107 persons (4{\%}) who were born after 1980 had preexisting cross-reactive antibody titers of 40 or more against 2009 H1N1, whereas 39 of 115 persons (34{\%}) born before 1950 had titers of 80 or more. Vaccination with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines resulted in an increase in the level of cross-reactive antibody to 2009 H1N1 by a factor of four or more in none of 55 children between the ages of 6 months and 9 years, in 12 to 22{\%} of 231 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and in 5{\%} or less of 113 adults 60 years of age or older. Seasonal vaccines that were formulated with adjuvant did not further enhance cross-reactive antibody responses. Vaccination with the A/New Jersey/1976 swine influenza vaccine substantially boosted cross-reactive antibodies to 2009 H1N1 in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with recent seasonal nonadjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza vaccines induced little or no cross-reactive antibody response to 2009 H1N1 in any age group. Persons under the age of 30 years had little evidence of cross-reactive antibodies to the pandemic virus. However, a proportion of older adults had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies.},

Moreover, we estimated that the infection attack rates were 78.0{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 63.5–86.3{\%}) in French Polynesia which closely matches a previous serological study; 20.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.1–50.0{\%}) in Colombia which suggests that the attack rate was most likely less than 50{\%}; and 32.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.5–94.2{\%}) in the State of Bahia in Brazil which suggests that the attack rate is unidentifiable with monthly data in Bahia. Furthermore, we found that the association of precipitation and ZIKV outbreak was more evident in Colombia than the other two places. These results are helpful for us to understand the possible evolution, to control the on-going outbreaks, to prevent the potential geographic spread, and to study the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of ZIKV.},

abstract = {Influenza is often regarded as an illness of the elderly portion of the population because most of the excess mortality associated with influenza epidemics occurs in that age group. However, evidence derived from a large number of clinical studies carried out in different countries and various settings has clearly demonstrated that the burden of influenza is also substantial in children. The attack rates of influenza during annual epidemics are consistently highest in children, and young children are hospitalized for influenza-related illnesses at rates comparable to those for adults with high-risk conditions. Especially among children younger than 3 years of age, influenza frequently predisposes the patient to bacterial complications such as acute otitis media. Children also serve as the main transmitters of influenza in the community. A safe and effective vaccine against influenza has been available for decades, but the vaccine is rarely used even for children with high-risk conditions. Despite several existing problems related to influenza vaccination of children, the current evidence indicates that the advantages of vaccinating young children would clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Considering the total burden of influenza in children, children younger than 3 years of age should be regarded as a high-risk group for influenza, analogously with the age-based definition of high risk among persons 65 years of age or older. Annual influenza vaccination should be recommended to all children from 6 months to 3 years of age.},

abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an existential threat to global public health. The virus has been repeatedly detected in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius). Adult animals in many countries in the Middle East as well as in North and East Africa showed high ({\textgreater}90{\%}) seroprevalence to the virus. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolated from dromedaries is genetically and phenotypically similar to viruses from humans. We summarize current understanding of the ecology of MERS-CoV in animals and transmission at the animal-human interface. We review aspects of husbandry, animal movements and trade and the use and consumption of camel dairy and meat products in the Middle East that may be relevant to the epidemiology of MERS. We also highlight the gaps in understanding the transmission of this virus in animals and from animals to humans.},

The PD 50 (50{\%} protective dose) of HI antibody was 1/18-1/36, but an unusual finding was that volunteers with no detectable pre-challenge antibody often seem to be less susceptible to infection than those with pre-challenge antibody in low titre.In one group of volunteers challenged with an influenza B strain there was no evidence that pre-challenge antibody titres against viral neuraminidase had any significant protective effect against challenge infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Two doses of either trivalent live attenuated or inactivated influenza vaccines (LAIV and TIV, respectively) are approved for young children (≥ 24 months old for LAIV and ≥ 6 months old for TIV) and induce protective antibody responses. However, whether combinations of LAIV and TIV are safe and equally immunogenic is unknown. Furthermore, LAIV is more protective than TIV in children for unclear reasons. METHODS Children 6-35 months old were administered, 1 month apart, 2 doses of either TIV or LAIV, or combinations of LAIV and TIV in both prime/boost sequences. Influenza-specific antibodies were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), and T cells were studied in flow cytometric and functional assays. Highly conserved M1, M2, and NP peptides predicted to be presented by common HLA class I and II were used to stimulate interferon-$\gamma$ enzyme-linked immunospot responses. RESULTS All LAIV and/or TIV combinations were well tolerated and induced similar HAI responses. In contrast, only regimens containing LAIV induced influenza-specific CD4(+), CD8(+), and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells, including T cells specific for highly conserved influenza peptides. CONCLUSIONS Prime/boost combinations of LAIV and TIV in young children were safe and induced similar protective antibodies. Only LAIV induced CD4(+), CD8(+), and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells relevant for broadly protective heterosubtypic immunity. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION NCT00231907.},

abstract = {Both live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) and inactivated
influenza vaccines (IIV) induce protective immunity against
influenza. There is evidence that LAIV induces superior
protection in children, whereas IIV may induce superior
protection in adults. The immune mechanisms responsible for these
differences have not been identified. We previously compared LAIV
and IIV in young children of 6 to 36 months of age, and we
demonstrated that while both induced similar hemagglutination
inhibition (HAI) antibody responses, only LAIV induced
significant increases in T cell responses. In the present study,
37 healthy adult subjects of 18 to 49 years of age were
randomized to receive seasonal influenza vaccination with LAIV or
IIV. Influenza virus-specific HAI, T cell, and secretory IgA
(sIgA) responses were studied pre- and postvaccination. In
contrast to the responses seen in young children, LAIV induced
only minimal increases in serum HAI responses in adults, which
were significantly lower than the responses induced by IIV. Both
LAIV and IIV similarly induced only transient T cell responses to
replication-competent whole virus in adults. In contrast,
influenza virus-specific sIgA responses were induced more
strongly by LAIV than by IIV. Our previous studies suggest that
LAIV may be more protective than IIV in young children not
previously exposed to influenza virus or influenza vaccines due
to increased vaccine-induced T cell and/or sIgA responses. Our
current work suggests that in adults with extensive and partially
cross-reactive preexisting influenza immunity, LAIV boosting of
sIgA responses to hemagglutinin (HA) and non-HA antigenic targets
expressed by circulating influenza virus strains may be an
important additional mechanism of vaccine-induced immunity.},

The model structure explicitly accounts for primary infections, reactivations and re-infections. Duration of infectiousness and likelihood of reactivation were both assumed to be age-dependent, and natural reduction in the re-infection risk following primary infection was included. We used an empirical social contact matrix (POLYMOD-based) as support for CMV transmission between different age groups. The baseline model reproduced well the age-stratified seroprevalence data (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III) used for calibration.

abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been established as a cause of microcephaly in newborns. Here we test the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental stages when the brain is undergoing rapid growth are particularly vulnerable to the effects of ZIKV infection. We injected ZIKV intracranially into wild type C57BL/6 mice at two different time points: early postnatal development, when the brain is growing at its maximal rate, and at weaning, when the brain has largely reached adult size. Both time points showed widespread immunoreactivity for ZIKV and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3, a marker of apoptosis) throughout the brain. However, in early postnatal ZIKV injected mice, some brain areas and cell types display particularly large increases in apoptosis that we did not observe in older animals. Corticospinal pyramidal neurons, a cell type implicated in human microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection, are an example of one such cell type. Proliferating cells in the ventricular zone stem cell compartment are also depleted. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that periods of rapid brain growth are especially susceptible to neurodevelopmental effects of ZIKV infection, and establish a valuable model to investigate mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental effects of ZIKV infection and explore candidate therapeutics.},

Controlling epidemic diseases corresponds to the introduction of vaccination, quarantine and treatment strategies; generally only one of these actions is considered. In this paper the possibility of optimal controls both over the susceptible and the infected subjects is assumed, taking into account also limitations of resources. A suitable cost index is introduced and via the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is determined and the existence of the optimal solution is assessed. Numerical results are developed analyzing the effects of different control strategies.},

abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (Aedes), similar to other arboviruses, first identified in Uganda in 1947. Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV activity had been reported in Africa and in Asia through virological surveillance and entomological studies. French Polynesia has recorded a large outbreak since October 2013. A great number of cases and some with neurological and autoimmune complications have been reported in a context of concurrent circulation of dengue viruses. The clinical presentation is a “dengue-like syndrome”. Until the epidemic in French Polynesia, no severe ZIKV disease had been described so far. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral genome detection by genomic amplification (RT- PCR) and viral isolation. These two large outbreaks occurred in a previously unaffected area in less than a decade. They should raise awareness as to the potential for ZIKV to spread especially since this emergent disease is not well known and that some questions remain on potential reservoirs and transmission modes as well as on clinical presentations and complications. ZIKV has the potential to spread to new areas where the Aedes mosquito vector is present and could be a risk for Southern Europe. Strategies for the prevention and control of ZIKV disease should include the use of insect repellent and mosquito vector eradication.

Bien que des {\'{e}}tudes de surveillance virologiques et entomologiques aient rapport{\'{e}} une activit{\'{e}} ZIKV en Afrique et en Asie, peu de cas humains avaient {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d{\'{e}}crits jusqu'en 2007, ann{\'{e}}e o{\`{u}} une {\'{e}}pid{\'{e}}mie de Zika a s{\'{e}}vi {\`{a}} Yap, en Micron{\'{e}}sie. Depuis octobre 2013, la Polyn{\'{e}}sie fran{\c{c}}aise conna{\^{i}}t une importante {\'{e}}pid{\'{e}}mie li{\'{e}}e au ZIKV avec un grand nombre de cas et certains avec des complications neurologiques et auto-immunes, rapport{\'{e}}s dans un contexte de circulation concomitante de virus de la dengue.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9)
virus were first reported in China in 2013 and continue to occur.
Hemagglutinin H7 administered alone is a poor immunogen
necessitating evaluation of adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines. OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated H7N9
vaccine with and without AS03 adjuvant, as well as mixed vaccine
schedules that included sequential administration of AS03- and
MF59-containing formulations and of adjuvanted and unadjuvanted
formulations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind,
phase 2 trial at 5 US sites enrolled 980 adults aged 19 through
64 years from September 2013 through November 2013; safety
follow-up was completed in January 2015. INTERVENTIONS: The H7N9
vaccine was given on days 0 and 21 at nominal doses of 3.75 µg,
7.5 µg, 15 µg, and 45 µg of hemagglutinin with or without AS03 or
MF59 adjuvant mixed on site. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
Proportions achieving a hemagglutination inhibition antibody
(HIA) titer of 40 or higher at 21 days after the second
vaccination; vaccine-related serious adverse events through 12
months after the first vaccination; and solicited signs and
symptoms after vaccination through day 7. RESULTS: Two doses of
vaccine were required to induce detectable antibody titers in
most participants. After 2 doses of an H7N9 formulation
containing 15 µg of hemagglutinin given without adjuvant, with
AS03 adjuvant, or with MF59 adjuvant, the proportion achieving an
HIA titer of 40 or higher was 2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-7{\%}) without
adjuvant (n = 94), 84{\%} (95{\%} CI, 76{\%}-91{\%}) with AS03 adjuvant
(n = 96), and 57{\%} (95{\%} CI, 47{\%}-68{\%}) with MF59 adjuvant (n =
92) (P {\textless} .001 for comparison of the AS03 and MF59 schedules). The
2 schedules alternating AS03-and MF59-adjuvanted formulations led
to lower geometric mean titers (GMTs) of (41.5 [95{\%} CI,
31.7-54.4]; n = 92) and (58.6 [95{\%} CI, 44.3-77.6]; n = 96) than
the group induced by 2 AS03-adjuvanted formulations (n = 96)
(103.4 [95{\%} CI, 78.7-135.9]; P {\textless} .001) but higher GMTs than 2
doses of MF59-adjuvanted formulation (n = 94) (29.0 [95{\%} CI,
22.4-37.6]; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The AS03 and
MF59 adjuvants augmented the immune responses to 2 doses of an
inactivated H7N9 influenza vaccine, with AS03-adjuvanted
formulations inducing the highest titers. This study of 2
adjuvants used in influenza vaccine formulations with adjuvant
mixed on site provides immunogenicity information that may be
informative to influenza pandemic preparedness programs. TRIAL

Healthy subjects 50 to 74 years old received the 2010-2011 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. We measured venous samples from Days 0, 28, and 75 for HI and VNA and B-cell ELISPOTs. Of 106 subjects, HI titers demonstrated a ceiling effect for 11 or 10{\%} for those with a pre-vaccination HI titer of 1:640 where no subject post-vaccination had an increase in titer. Of the remaining 95 subjects, only 37 or 35{\%} overall had at least a 4-fold increase by Day 28. Of these 37, 3 waned at least 4-fold, and 13 others 2-fold. Thus 15{\%} of the subjects showed waning antibody titers by Day 75. More than half failed to respond at all. The profiles populated by these subjects as defined by HI did not vary with age or gender. The VNA results mimicked the HI profiles, but the profiles for B-cell ELISPOT did not.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the risk of microcephaly in babies born to women infected by the Zika virus during pregnancy in Brazil in an epidemic between 2015 and 2016. METHODS We obtained data on the number of notified and confirmed microcephaly cases in each Brazilian state between November 2015 and October 2016 from the health ministry. For Pernambuco State, one of the hardest hit, weekly data were available from August 2015 to October 2016 for different definitions of microcephaly. The absolute risk of microcephaly was calculated using the average number of live births reported in each state in the corresponding time period between 2012 and 2014 and assuming two infection rates: 10{\%} and 50{\%}. The relative risk was estimated using the reported background frequency of microcephaly in Brazil of 1.98 per 10 000 live births. FINDINGS The estimated absolute risk of a notified microcephaly case varied from 0.03 to 17.1{\%} according to geographical area, the definition of microcephaly used and the infection rate. Assuming a 50{\%} infection rate, there was an 18-127 fold higher probability of microcephaly in children born to mothers with infection during pregnancy compared with children born to mothers without infection during pregnancy in Pernambuco State. For a 10{\%} infection rate, the probability was 88-635 folds higher. CONCLUSION A large variation in the estimated risk of microcephaly was found in Brazil. Research is needed into possible effect modifiers, reliable measures of Zika virus infection and clear endpoints for congenital malformations.

OBJETIVO Estimar el riesgo de microcefalia en beb{\'{e}}s nacidos de mujeres infectadas por el virus de Zika durante el embarazo en Brasil en una epidemia desatada entre 2015 y 2016. M{\'{E}}TODOS Se obtuvieron datos del Ministerio de Salud sobre el n{\'{u}}mero de casos de microcefalia notificados y confirmados en todos los estados de Brasil entre noviembre de 2015 y octubre de 2016. En el estado de Pernambuco, uno de los m{\'{a}}s afectados, se dispon{\'{i}}a de datos semanales desde agosto de 2015 hasta octubre de 2016 para diferentes definiciones de microcefalia. Se calcul{\'{o}} el riesgo absoluto de microcefalia utilizando la cifra media de nacidos vivos registrados en todos los estados en el periodo de tiempo correspondiente entre 2012 y 2014 y asumiendo dos tasas de infecci{\'{o}}n: 10{\%} y 50{\%}. El riesgo relativo se estim{\'{o}} utilizando la frecuencia de fondo de microcefalia registrada en Brasil de 1,98 por cada 10 000 nacidos vivos. RESULTADOS El riesgo absoluto estimado de una microcefalia notificada vari{\'{o}} del 0,03{\%} al 17,1{\%} seg{\'{u}}n la zona geogr{\'{a}}fica, la definici{\'{o}}n de microcefalia utilizada y la tasa de infecci{\'{o}}n. Asumiendo una tasa de infecci{\'{o}}n del 50{\%}, hubo una probabilidad de microcefalia de 18 a 127 veces mayor en los ni{\~{n}}os nacidos de madres infectadas por el virus de Zika durante el embarazo, en comparaci{\'{o}}n con los nacidos de madres no infectadas por el virus de Zika durante el embarazo en el estado de Pernambuco. Con una tasa de infecci{\'{o}}n del 10{\%}, la probabilidad fue de 88 a 635 veces mayor. CONCLUSI{\'{O}}N En Brasil, se descubri{\'{o}} una gran variaci{\'{o}}n en cuanto al riesgo estimado de microcefalia. Es necesario realizar una investigaci{\'{o}}n sobre posibles modificadores de efectos, medidas fiables para el contagio del virus de Zika y resultados claros para malformaciones cong{\'{e}}nitas. الغرض تقدير خطر وقوع الصعل (صغر الرأس) للرضع المولودين لنساء قد أُصبن بعدوى فيروس زيكا خلال فترة الحمل في البرازيل في سياق الانتشار الوبائي الذي حدث في الفترة بين عامي 2015 و2016. الطريقة حصلنا على بيانات عن عدد حالات الإخطار بوقوع الصعل والحالات المؤكدة لوقوعه في دولة البرازيل في الفترة بين تشرين الثاني/نوفمبر 2015 وتشرين الأول/أكتوبر 2016، وذلك من خلال وزارة الصحة. وبالنظر إلى ولاية بيرنامبوكو، التي تمثل واحدة من أكثر المناطق المنكوبة بالمرض، كانت البيانات متاحةً أسبوعيًا في الفترة من أغسطس/آب 2015 حتى أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2016 فيما يتعلق بتعريفات مختلفة للصعل. وتم احتساب الاختطار المطلق للإصابة بالصعل باستخدام متوسط عدد المواليد الأحياء الذين تم الإبلاغ بهم في كل ولاية في الفترة الزمنية المناظرة بين عامي 2012 و2014 مع افتراض معدلين للإصابة بالعدوى: 10‏{\%} و50‏{\%}. وتم تقدير الاختطار النسبي باستخدام المعدل السابق لتكرار الإصابة بالصعل والذي تم الإبلاغ به في البرازيل حيث بلغ 1.98 من كل 10 آلاف مولود من المواليد الأحياء. النتائج تباين الاختطار النسبي المقدَّر فيما يتعلق بحالات الإصابة بالصعل التي تم الإخطار بها حيث تراوح بين 0.03 و‏17.1‏{\%}، وتوقف ذلك على المنطقة الجغرافية والتعريف المستخدم للصعل ومعدل الإصابة بالعدوى. وبافتراض وصول معدل الإصابة إلى ‏50{\%}، ارتفع احتمال الإصابة بالصعل لدى الأطفال المولودين لأمهات مصابات بعدوى فيروس زيكا بمقدار 18 – 127 مرة أثناء فترة الحمل في بيرنامبوكو. أما بالنظر إلى معدل الإصابة بالعدوى البالغ 10‏{\%}، فقد ارتفع هذا الاحتمال بمقدار 88 – 635 مرة. الاستنتاج تم التوصل إلى وجود تباين كبير في الخطر الذي تم تقديره فيما يتعلق بالإصابة بالصعل في البرازيل. ويحتاج الأمر إلى إجراء البحث العلمي بشأن العوامل المحتملة لتغيير التأثير، وما يمكن الاعتماد عليه من الإجراءات الواجب اتخاذها حيال عدوى فيروس زيكا ونقاط نهاية واضحة للتشوهات الولادية. 目的 旨在估测 2015 至 2016 年流行病蔓延期间孕期感染寨卡病毒女性所生婴儿的小头症患病风险。. 方法 我们从卫生部获取了 2015 年 11 月至 2016 年 10 月期间巴西各州通报及确认的小头症病例的数据。 从伯南布哥州,患病重灾区之一,可获取其 2015 年 8 月至 2016 年 10 月期间具有不同定义的小头症的周数据。 小头症绝对患病风险的计算采用各州在 2012 年至 2014 年相应时间段内呈报的活产婴儿的平均数量,并假设两个感染率为: 10{\%} 和 50{\%}。 相对风险采用巴西每 10,000 个活产婴儿中 1.98 例小头症患儿这一报道背景频率进行估测。. 结果 根据地理区域、所采用的小头症定义以及感染率的不同,所呈报小头症的估测绝对患病风险也有所不同,其变化范围为 0.03 至 17.1{\%}。 在伯南布哥州,假设感染率为 50{\%},相较于未在孕期感染寨卡病毒的母亲所生的婴儿,孕期感染寨卡病毒母亲所生婴儿的小头症患病可能性高出前者 18-127 倍。 若感染率为 10{\%},该可能性则高出前者 88-635 倍。. 结论 经发现,在巴西,估测的小头症患病风险有较大差异。 仍需对寨卡病毒感染及先天性畸形确切终结点的可能影响效应及可靠措施进行研究。. Цель Оценить риск микроцефалии у младенцев, рожденных от женщин, которые заразились вирусом Зика во время беременности в Бразилии в период эпидемии между 2015 и 2016 годами. Методы Министерство здравоохранения предоставило данные о количестве зарегистрированных и подтвержденных случаев микроцефалии в каждом штате Бразилии в период с ноября 2015 года по октябрь 2016 года. По штату Пернамбуку, который был одним из наиболее пострадавших штатов, были доступны еженедельные данные для различных определений микроцефалии в период с августа 2015 года по октябрь 2016 года. Абсолютный риск микроцефалии рассчитали с помощью среднего количества живорожденных младенцев, зарегистрированных в каждом штате в соответствующий период времени между 2012 и 2014 годами, принимая во внимание два уровня заболеваемости: 10 и 50{\%}. Для оценки относительного риска использовалась зарегистрированная фоновая частота микроцефалии в Бразилии, составлявшая 1,98 на 10 000 живорожденных младенцев. Результаты Полученный абсолютный риск зарегистрированного случая микроцефалии колебался от 0,03 до 17,1{\%}, в зависимости от географического района, используемого определения микроцефалии и уровня заболеваемости. При предположительном уровне заболеваемости, равном 50{\%}, вероятность развития микроцефалии у детей, рожденных от матерей с вирусной инфекцией Зика во время беременности, по сравнению с детьми, рожденными от матерей без вирусной инфекции Зика во время беременности, была в 18–127 раз выше в штате Пернамбуку. Для 10-процентного уровня заболеваемости вероятность была в 88–635 раз выше. Вывод В Бразилии был обнаружен большой разброс в оценке риска развития микроцефалии. Необходимы дальнейшие исследования возможных модификаторов эффекта, надежных показателей вирусной инфекции Зика и четких конечных критериев оценки для врожденных пороков развития.},

Prior natural infection and live ca vaccine significantly reduced ca virus shedding after challenge compared with inactivated vaccine or no prior exposure to influenza A virus. Prechallenge nasal IgA, detected almost exclusively in subjects naturally infected or vaccinated with live ca virus, was associated with protection.

Because individuals are repeatedly exposed to antigenically and genetically diverse influenza viruses over a lifetime, the gold standard for detection of a recent influenza virus infection or response to current vaccination is the demonstration of a seroconversion, a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer relative to a baseline sample, to a circulating influenza strain or vaccine component. The hemagglutination-inhibition assay remains the most widely used assay to detect strain-specific serum antibodies to influenza. The hemagglutination-inhibition assay is also used to monitor antigenic changes among influenza viruses which are constantly evolving; such antigenic data is essential for consideration of changes in influenza vaccine composition.

abstract = {The role of pre-existing immunity for influenza vaccine responses is of great importance for public health, and thus has been studied in various contexts, yet the impact of differential priming on vaccine responses in the midst of antigenic drift remains to be elucidated. To address this with antigenically related viruses, mice were first primed by either infection or immunization with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus, then immunized with whole-inactivated A/Fort Monmouth/1/47 (FM1) virus. The ensuing vaccine responses and the protective efficacy of FM1 were superior in PR8 infection-primed mice compared to PR8 immunization-primed or unprimed mice. Increased FM1-specific Ab responses of PR8 infection-primed mice also broadened cross-reactivity against contemporary as well as antigenically more drifted strains. Further, prior infection heightened the protective efficacy of antigenically distant strains, such as A/Brisbane/59/2006 infection followed by immunization with split pandemic H1N1 vaccine (A/California/07/2009). Therefore, influenza infection is a significant priming event that intensifies future vaccine responses against drift strains.},

abstract = {The majority of vaccine candidates in clinical development are highly purified proteins and peptides relying on adjuvants to enhance and/or direct immune responses. Despite the acknowledged need for novel adjuvants, there are still very few adjuvants in licensed human vaccines. A vast number of adjuvants have been tested pre-clinically using different experimental conditions, rendering it impossible to directly compare their activity. We performed a head-to-head comparison of five different adjuvants Alum, MF59{\textregistered}, GLA-SE, IC31{\textregistered} and CAF01 in mice and combined these with antigens from M. tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia to test immune-profiles and efficacy in infection models using standardized protocols. Regardless of antigen, each adjuvant had a unique immunological signature suggesting that the adjuvants have potential for different disease targets. Alum increased antibody titers; MF59{\textregistered} induced strong antibody and IL-5 responses; GLA-SE induced antibodies and Th1; CAF01 showed a mixed Th1/Th17 profile and IC31{\textregistered} induced strong Th1 responses. MF59{\textregistered} and GLA-SE were strong inducers of influenza HI titers while CAF01, GLA-SE and IC31{\textregistered} enhanced protection to TB and chlamydia. Importantly, this is the first extensive attempt to categorize clinical-grade adjuvants based on their immune profiles and protective efficacy to inform a rational development of next generation vaccines for human use.},

Knowledge of the contemporary distribution of their shared vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus remains incomplete and is complicated by an ongoing range expansion fuelled by increased global trade and travel. Mapping the global distribution of these vectors and the geographical determinants of their ranges is essential for public health planning. Here we compile the largest contemporary database for both species and pair it with relevant environmental variables predicting their global distribution. We show Aedes distributions to be the widest ever recorded; now extensive in all continents, including North America and Europe. These maps will help define the spatial limits of current autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses. It is only with this kind of rigorous entomological baseline that we can hope to project future health impacts of these viruses.},

abstract = {In order to assess the level of protection against a lethal
influenza virus infection provided by a primary infection with a
virus strain of another subtype, C57BL/6 mice were infected with
the sublethal influenza virus X-31 (H3N2) and subsequently
challenged with the lethal strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The outcome
of the challenge infection was compared with that in mice that
did not experience an infection with influenza virus X-31 prior
to the challenge infection. The X-31 experienced mice cleared the
infection with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 in an accelerated
fashion, displayed less clinical signs and a reduction of lesions
in the lungs resulting in improved survival rates of these mice
compared to the naive mice. The improved outcome of the challenge
infection with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 in the X-31 experienced
mice correlated with priming for anamnestic virus-specific CD8(+)
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses as was demonstrated by the
detection of CTL specific for the H-2D(b) restricted NP(366-374)
epitope that was shared by the influenza viruses X-31 and
A/PR/8/34. Thus previous exposure to influenza A viruses affords
partial protection against infection in the absence of
virus-neutralizing antibodies specific for the hemagglutinin and
the neuraminidase. The implications of these observations are
discussed in the light of the current pandemic threat and
development of vaccines that aim at the induction of

abstract = {Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of respiratory tract
infection with attack rates of 5-10{\%}. This means that humans are
infected repeatedly with intervals of, on average, 10-20 years.
Upon each infection subjects develop innate and adaptive immune
responses which aim at clearing the infection. Strain-specific
antibody responses are induced, which exert selective pressure on
circulating influenza viruses and which drive antigenic drift of
seasonal influenza viruses, especially in the hemagglutinin
molecule. This antigenic drift necessitates updating of seasonal
influenza vaccines regularly in order to match the circulating
strains. Upon infection also virus-specific T cell responses are
induced, including CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T
cells. These cells are mainly directed to conserved proteins and
therefore display cross-reactivity with a variety of influenza A
viruses of different subtypes. T cell mediated immunity therefore
may contribute to so-called heterosubtypic immunity and may
afford protection against antigenically distinct, potentially
pandemic influenza viruses. At present, novel viral targets are
identified that may help to develop broad-protective vaccines.
Here we review the various arms of the immune response to
influenza virus infections and their viral targets and discuss
the possibility of developing universal vaccines. The development
of such novel vaccines would imply that also new immune
correlates of protection need to be established in order to
facilitate assessment of vaccine efficacy.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The age distribution of influenza A(H5N1) cases reported during 2006-2013 varied substantially between countries. As well as underlying demographic profiles, it is possible that cross-immunity contributed to the age distribution of reported cases: seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and avian influenza A(H5N1) share the same neuraminidase subtype, N1. Using a mechanistic model, we measured the extent to which population age distribution and heterosubtypic cross-immunity could explain the observed age patterns in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. Our results support experimental evidence that prior infection with H1N1 confers partial cross-immunity to H5N1, and suggest that more than 50{\%} of spillover events did not lead to reported cases of infection as a result. We also identified age groups that have additional risk factors for influenza A(H5N1) not captured by demography or infection history.},

abstract = {Since its emergence in 1968, influenza A (H3N2) has evolved extensively in genotype and antigenic phenotype. However, despite strong pressure to evolve away from human immunity and to diversify in antigenic phenotype, H3N2 influenza shows paradoxically limited genetic and antigenic diversity present at any one time. Here, we propose a simple model of antigenic evolution in the influenza virus that accounts for this apparent discrepancy. In this model, antigenic phenotype is represented by a N-dimensional vector, and virus mutations perturb phenotype within this continuous Euclidean space. We implement this model in a large-scale individual-based simulation, and in doing so, we find a remarkable correspondence between model behavior and observed influenza dynamics. This model displays rapid evolution but low standing diversity and simultaneously accounts for the epidemiological, genetic, antigenic, and geographical patterns displayed by the virus. We find that evolution away from existing human immunity results in rapid population turnover in the influenza virus and that this population turnover occurs primarily along a single antigenic axis. Selective dynamics induce a canalized evolutionary trajectory, in which the evolutionary fate of the influenza population is surprisingly repeatable. In the model, the influenza population shows a 1- to 2-year timescale of repeatability, suggesting a window in which evolutionary dynamics could be, in theory, predictable.},

abstract = {The immunity of a host population against specific influenza A
strains can influence a number of important biological processes,
from the emergence of new virus strains to the effectiveness of
vaccination programmes. However, the development of an
individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza A over the
course of a lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately
describing this immunological process requires a fundamental
understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and
cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the
contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains
challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over
a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate
effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a
mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent
antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using
cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains
spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza A(H3N2) in southern
China. We found that ``antigenic seniority'' and quickly decaying
cross-reactivity were important components of the immune
response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were
infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation
titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the
frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which
indicate that although infections became less frequent as
individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood,
they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. By
establishing what are likely to be important mechanisms driving
epochal trends in population immunity, we also identified key
directions for future studies. In particular, our results
highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested
against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better
understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast,
transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune
responses considered here.},

abstract = {When multiple infections are possible during an individual's lifetime, as with influenza, a host's history of infection and immunity will determine the result of future exposures. In turn, the suite of varying individual infection histories will shape the population level dynamics of the disease. Exploring the consequences of precisely how immunity is acquired using mathematical models has proven challenging though: if n strains have circulated previously, there are 2n combinations of past infection to consider. However, by using an age-structured mathematical model of a disease with multiple strains, we can examine the population immune profile without explicitly keeping track of all possible infection histories. This framework allows previously unknown consequences of assumptions about immune acquisition to be observed. In particular, we see that ‘original antigenic sin' can reduce immunity in some age groups: these immune blind spots could be responsible for the unexpectedly high severity of certain past influenza epidemics.},

abstract = {Variability in the risk of transmission for respiratory pathogens can result from several factors, including the intrinsic properties of the pathogen, the immune state of the host and the host's behaviour. It has been proposed that self-reported social mixing patterns can explain the behavioural component of this variability, with simulated intervention studies based on these data used routinely to inform public health policy. However, in the absence of robust studies with biological endpoints for individuals, it is unclear how age and social behaviour contribute to infection risk. To examine how the structure and nature of social contacts influenced infection risk over the course of a single epidemic, we designed a flexible disease modelling framework: the population was divided into a series of increasingly detailed age and social contact classes, with the transmissibility of each age-contact class determined by the average contacts of that class. Fitting the models to serologically confirmed infection data from the 2009 Hong Kong influenza A/H1N1p pandemic, we found that an individual's risk of infection was influenced strongly by the average reported social mixing behaviour of their age group, rather than by their personal reported contacts. We also identified the resolution of social mixing that shaped transmission: epidemic dynamics were driven by intense contacts between children, a post-childhood drop in risky contacts and a subsequent rise in contacts for individuals aged 35-50. Our results demonstrate that self-reported social contact surveys can account for age-associated heterogeneity in the transmission of a respiratory pathogen in humans, and show robustly how these individual-level behaviours manifest themselves through assortative age groups. Our results suggest it is possible to profile the social structure of different populations and to use these aggregated data to predict their inherent transmission potential.},

abstract = {Pathogens such as MERS-CoV, influenza A/H5N1 and influenza A/H7N9 are currently generating sporadic clusters of spillover human cases from animal reservoirs. The lack of a clear human epidemic suggests that the basic reproductive number R0 is below or very close to one for all three infections. However, robust cluster-based estimates for low R0 values are still desirable so as to help prioritise scarce resources between different emerging infections and to detect significant changes between clusters and over time. We developed an inferential transmission model capable of distinguishing the signal of human-to-human transmission from the background noise of direct spillover transmission (e.g. from markets or farms). By simulation, we showed that our approach could obtain unbiased estimates of R0, even when the temporal trend in spillover exposure was not fully known, so long as the serial interval of the infection and the timing of a sudden drop in spillover exposure were known (e.g. day of market closure). Applying our method to data from the three largest outbreaks of influenza A/H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013, we found evidence that human-to-human transmission accounted for 13{\%} (95{\%} credible interval 1{\%}-32{\%}) of cases overall. We estimated R0 for the three clusters to be: 0.19 in Shanghai (0.01-0.49), 0.29 in Jiangsu (0.03-0.73); and 0.03 in Zhejiang (0.00-0.22). If a reliable temporal trend for the spillover hazard could be estimated, for example by implementing widespread routine sampling in sentinel markets, it should be possible to estimate sub-critical values of R0 even more accurately. Should a similar strain emerge with R0{\textgreater}1, these methods could give a real-time indication that sustained transmission is occurring with well-characterised uncertainty.},

abstract = {The menu of diagnostic tools that can be utilized to establish a diagnosis of influenza is extensive and includes classic virology techniques as well as new and emerging methods. This review of how the various existing diagnostic methods have been utilized, first in the context of a rapidly evolving outbreak of novel influenza virus and then during the different subsequent phases and waves of the pandemic, demonstrates the unique roles, advantages, and limitations of each of these methods. Rapid antigen tests were used extensively throughout the pandemic. Recognition of the low negative predictive values of these tests is important. Private laboratories with preexisting expertise, infrastructure, and resources for rapid development, validation, and implementation of laboratory-developed assays played an unprecedented role in helping to meet the diagnostic demands during the pandemic. FDA-cleared assays remain an important element of the diagnostic armamentarium during a pandemic, and a process must be developed with the FDA to allow manufacturers to modify these assays for detection of novel strains in a timely fashion. The need and role for subtyping of influenza viruses and antiviral susceptibility testing will likely depend on qualitative (circulating subtypes and their resistance patterns) and quantitative (relative prevalence) characterization of influenza viruses circulating during future epidemics and pandemics.},

Next-generation DNA sequencing now provides the opportunity to survey this complex and vast repertoire. In the present work, we describe a set of tools for the analysis of antibody repertoires and their application to elucidating the dynamics of the response to viral vaccination in human volunteers. By analyzing data from 38 separate blood samples across 2 y, we found that the use of the germ-line library of V and J segments is conserved between individuals over time. Surprisingly, there appeared to be no correlation between the use level of a particular VJ combination and degree of expansion. We found the antibody RNA repertoire in each volunteer to be highly dynamic, with each individual displaying qualitatively different response dynamics. By using combinatorial phage display, we screened selected VH genes paired with their corresponding VL library for affinity against the vaccine antigens. Altogether, this work presents an additional set of tools for profiling the human antibody repertoire and demonstrates characterization of the fast repertoire dynamics through time in multiple individuals responding to an immune challenge.},

reported for infection and hospitalizations with pandemic H1N1
influenza (A[H1N1]pdm) in the 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons in
the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Serological analysis of
prepandemic samples has shown a higher incidence of
cross-reactive antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm virus in older
populations; conserved T cell epitopes between viruses have been
identified. The contribution of preexisting immunity to seasonal
influenza to protection against A(H1N1)pdm infection was analyzed
in a ferret model. METHODS: Ferrets were pre-infected with
influenza A viruses and/or vaccinated with inactivated influenza
viruses with adjuvant. Infection after challenge was assessed by
measuring shedding virus, transmission to naive animals, and
seroconversion. RESULTS: Homologous vaccination reduced the
incidence of infection and delayed transmission. Pre-infection
with virus induced sterilizing immunity to homologous challenge.
One prior infection with seasonal influenza A virus improved
clearance of A(H1N1)pdm virus. Prior infection with A(H1N1)pdm
virus reduced shedding after seasonal influenza A challenge. Two
infections with seasonal influenza A viruses reduced the
incidence of infection, the amount and duration of virus
shedding, and the frequency of transmission following A(H1N1)pdm
challenge. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the reduced incidence
and severity of infection with A(H1N1)pdm virus in the adult
population during the 2009-2010 influenza season may be a result
of previous exposure to seasonal influenza A viruses.},

Infection after challenge was assessed by measuring shedding virus, transmission to naive animals, and seroconversion. RESULTS: Homologous vaccination reduced the incidence of infection and delayed transmission. Pre-infection with virus induced sterilizing immunity to homologous challenge. One prior infection with seasonal influenza A virus improved clearance of A(H1N1)pdm virus. Prior infection with A(H1N1)pdm virus reduced shedding after seasonal influenza A challenge. Two infections with seasonal influenza A viruses reduced the incidence of infection, the amount and duration of virus shedding, and the frequency of transmission following A(H1N1)pdm challenge. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the reduced incidence and severity of infection with A(H1N1)pdm virus in the adult population during the 2009-2010 influenza season may be a result of previous exposure to seasonal influenza A viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An age bias toward children and young adults has been reported for infection and hospitalizations with pandemic H1N1 influenza (A[H1N1]pdm) in the 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Serological analysis of prepandemic samples has shown a higher incidence of cross-reactive antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm virus in older populations; conserved T cell epitopes between viruses have been identified.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serological studies can detect infection with a novel influenza virus in the absence of symptoms or positive virology, providing useful information on infection that goes beyond the estimates from epidemiological, clinical and virological data. During the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, an impressive number of detailed serological studies were performed, yet the majority of serological data were available only after the first wave of infection. This limited the ability to estimate the transmissibility and severity of this novel infection, and the variability in methodology and reporting limited the ability to compare and combine the serological data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES:   To identify best practices for conduct and standardisation of serological studies on outbreak and pandemic influenza to inform public policy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/SETTING: An international meeting was held in February 2011 in Ottawa, Canada, to foster the consensus for greater standardisation of influenza serological studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Best practices for serological investigations of influenza epidemiology include the following: classification of studies as pre-pandemic, outbreak, pandemic or inter-pandemic with a clearly identified objective; use of international serum standards for laboratory assays; cohort and cross-sectional study designs with common standards for data collection; use of serum banks to improve sampling capacity; and potential for linkage of serological, clinical and epidemiological data. Advance planning for outbreak studies would enable a rapid and coordinated response; inclusion of serological studies in pandemic plans should be considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Optimising the quality, comparability and combinability of influenza serological studies will provide important data upon emergence of a novel or variant influenza virus to inform public health action.},

abstract = {Estimation of influenza infection rates is important for determination of the extent of epidemic spread and for calculation of severity indicators. The authors compared estimated infection rates from paired and cross-sectional serologic surveys, rates of influenza like illness (ILI) obtained from sentinel general practitioners (GPs), and ILI samples that tested positive for influenza using data from similar periods collected during the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Singapore. The authors performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of estimates to input parameter uncertainties, and they determined sample sizes required for differing levels of precision. Estimates from paired seroconversion were 17{\%} (95{\%} Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 14, 20), higher than those from cross-sectional serology (12{\%}, 95{\%} BCI: 9, 17). Adjusted ILI estimates were 15{\%} (95{\%} BCI: 10, 25), and estimates computed from ILI and laboratory data were 12{\%} (95{\%} BCI: 8, 18). Serologic estimates were least sensitive to the risk of input parameter misspecification. ILI-based estimates were more sensitive to parameter misspecification, though this was lessened by incorporation of laboratory data. Obtaining a 5-percentage-point spread for the 95{\%} confidence interval in infection rates would require more than 1,000 participants per serologic study, a sentinel network of 90 GPs, or 50 GPs when combined with laboratory samples. The various types of estimates will provide comparable findings if accurate input parameters can be obtained.},

abstract = {Variation in influenza incidence between locations is commonly observed on large spatial scales. It is unclear whether such variation occurs on smaller spatial scales and whether it is the result of heterogeneities in population demographics or more subtle differences in population structure and connectivity. Here we show that significant differences in immunity to influenza A viruses among communities in China are not explained by differences in population demographics. We randomly selected households from five randomly selected locations near Guangzhou, China to answer a questionnaire and provide a blood sample for serological testing against five recently circulating influenza viruses. We find a significant reduction in the frequency of detectable neutralization titers with increasing age, levelling off in older age groups. There are significant differences between locations in age, employment status, vaccination history, household size and housing conditions. However, after adjustment, significant variations in the frequency of detectable neutralization titers persists between locations. These results suggest there are characteristics of communities that drive influenza transmission dynamics apart from individual and household level risk factors, and that such factors have effects independent of strain.},

abstract = {In late April 2009 the emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm) virus was detected in humans. From its detection through July 18th, 2009, confirmed cases of H1N1pdm in the Americas were periodically reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) by member states. Because the Americas span much of the world's latitudes, this data provides an excellent opportunity to examine variation in H1N1pdm transmission by season.Using reports from PAHO member states from April 26th, 2009 through July 18th, 2009, we characterize the early spread of the H1N1 pandemic in the Americas. For a geographically representative sample of member states we estimate the reproductive number (R) of H1N1pdm over the reporting period. The association between these estimates and latitude, temperature, humidity and population age structure was estimated.Estimates of the peak reproductive number of H1N1pdm ranged from 1.3 (for Panama, Colombia) to 2.1 (for Chile). We found that reproductive number estimates were most associated with latitude in both univariate and multivariate analyses. To the extent that latitude is a proxy for seasonal changes in climate and behavior, this association suggests a strong seasonal component to H1N1pdm transmission. However, the reasons for this seasonality remain unclear. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection. METHODS In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. FINDINGS We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95{\%} credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95{\%} of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95{\%} CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95{\%} CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95{\%} CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7{\%} (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95{\%} CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29{\%} (RR: 0.71; 95{\%} CrI: 0.28-0.88). CONCLUSION Neither symptom- nor antibody-based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high-incidence areas.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

exposure to influenza A is that the first strain infecting an
individual apparently produces the strongest adaptive immune
response. Although antibody titers measure that response, the

cross reactivity and immune waning. From July to September 2009,
we collected serum samples from 151 residents of Guangdong
Province, China, 7 to 81 years of age. Neutralization tests were
performed against strains representing six antigenic clusters of
H3N2 influenza circulating between 1968 and 2008, and three
recent locally circulating strains. Patterns of neutralization
titers were compared based on age at time of testing and age at
time of the first isolation of each virus. Neutralization titers
were highest for H3N2 strains that circulated in an individual's
first decade of life (peaking at 7 years). Further, across
strains and ages at testing, statistical models strongly
supported a pattern of titers declining smoothly with age at the
time a strain was first isolated. Those born 10 or more years
after a strain emerged generally had undetectable neutralization
titers to that strain ({\textless}1:10). Among those over 60 at time of
testing, titers tended to increase with age. The observed pattern
in H3N2 neutralization titers can be characterized as one of

'senior' strains encountered earlier in life.},

Being probabilistic, the schemes described here have a finite probability of failure; in most cases, this probability is rather negligible (10(-17) is a typical value). In many situations, the new procedures are considerably more efficient and reliable than the classical (deterministic) ones; they also parallelize naturally.

children and elderly individuals. However, H1N1 viruses
disproportionately affected middle-aged adults during the
2013-2014 influenza season. Although H1N1 viruses recently
acquired several mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA)
glycoprotein, classic serological tests used by surveillance
laboratories indicate that these mutations do not change
antigenic properties of the virus. Here, we show that one of
these mutations is located in a region of HA targeted by
antibodies elicited in many middle-aged adults. We find that over
42{\%} of individuals born between 1965 and 1979 possess antibodies
that recognize this region of HA. Our findings offer a possible
antigenic explanation of why middle-aged adults were highly
susceptible to H1N1 viruses during the 2013-2014 influenza
season. Our data further suggest that a drifted H1N1 strain
should be included in future influenza vaccines to potentially
reduce morbidity and mortality in this age group.},

abstract = {Despite evidence that vaccinating schoolchildren against influenza is effective in limiting community-level transmission, the United States has had a long-standing government strategy of recommending that vaccine be concentrated primarily in high-risk groups and distributed to those people who keep the health system and social infrastructure operating. Because of this year's influenza vaccine shortage, a plan was enacted to distribute the limited vaccine stock to these groups first. This vaccination strategy, based on direct protection of those most at risk, has not been very effective in reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. Although it is too late to make changes this year, the current influenza vaccine crisis affords the opportunity to examine an alternative for future years. The alternative plan, supported by mathematical models and influenza field studies, would be to concentrate vaccine in schoolchildren, the population group most responsible for transmission, while also covering the reachable high-risk groups, who would also receive considerable indirect protection. In conjunction with a plan to ensure an adequate vaccine supply, this alternative influenza vaccination strategy would help control interpandemic influenza and be instrumental in preparing for pandemic influenza. The effectiveness of the alternative plan could be assessed through nationwide community studies.},

@article{Lythgoe2017,
abstract = {With extremely short generation times and high mutability, many viruses can rapidly evolve and adapt to changing environments. This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus' adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of short-sighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a 'germline' lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution. These concepts provide a new perspective on the way in which some viruses have been able to establish and maintain global pandemics.},

stalk domain of the viral hemagglutinin have attracted increasing
attention in recent years. However, only a limited number of
stalk antibodies directed against group 2 influenza
hemagglutinins have been isolated so far. Also, little is known
about the general level of induction of these antibodies by
influenza virus vaccination or infection. To characterize the
anti-stalk humoral response in the mouse model as well as in
humans, chimeric hemagglutinin constructs previously developed in
our group were employed in serological assays. Whereas influenza
virus infection induced high titers of stalk-reactive antibodies,
immunization with inactivated influenza virus vaccines failed to
do so in the mouse model. Analysis of serum samples collected
from human individuals who were infected by influenza viruses
also revealed the induction of stalk-reactive antibodies.
Finally, we show that the hemagglutinin stalk-directed antibodies
induced in mice and humans have broad reactivity and neutralizing
activity in vitro and in vivo. The results of the study point
toward the existence of highly conserved epitopes in the stalk
domains of group 2 hemagglutinins, which can be targeted for the
development of a universal influenza virus vaccine in humans.},

@article{Martines2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND
Zika virus is an arthropod-borne virus that is a member of the family Flaviviridae transmitted mainly by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Although usually asymptomatic, infection can result in a mild and self-limiting illness characterised by fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. An increase in the number of children born with microcephaly was noted in 2015 in regions of Brazil with high transmission of Zika virus. More recently, evidence has been accumulating supporting a link between Zika virus and microcephaly. Here, we describe findings from three fatal cases and two spontaneous abortions associated with Zika virus infection. 

METHODS
In this case series, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from five cases, including two newborn babies with microcephaly and severe arthrogryposis who died shortly after birth, one 2-month-old baby, and two placentas from spontaneous abortions, from Brazil were submitted to the Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) between December, 2015, and March, 2016. Specimens were assessed by histopathological examination, immunohistochemical assays using a mouse anti-Zika virus antibody, and RT-PCR assays targeting the NS5 and envelope genes. Amplicons of RT-PCR positive cases were sequenced for characterisation of strains. 

FINDINGS
Viral antigens were localised to glial cells and neurons and associated with microcalcifications in all three fatal cases with microcephaly. Antigens were also seen in chorionic villi of one of the first trimester placentas. Tissues from all five cases were positive for Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR, and sequence analyses showed highest identities with Zika virus strains isolated from Brazil during 2015. 

INTERPRETATION
These findings provide strong evidence of a link between Zika virus infection and different congenital central nervous system malformations, including microcephaly as well as arthrogryposis and spontaneous abortions.

abstract = {A powerful and flexible method for fitting dynamic models to missing and censored data is to use the Bayesian paradigm via data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC). This samples from the joint posterior for the parameters and missing data, but requires high memory overheads for large-scale systems. In addition, designing efficient proposal distributions for the missing data is typically challenging. Pseudo-marginal methods instead integrate across the missing data using a Monte Carlo estimate for the likelihood, generated from multiple independent simulations from the model. These techniques can avoid the high memory requirements of DA-MCMC, and under certain conditions produce the exact marginal posterior distribution for parameters. A novel method is presented for implementing importance sampling for dynamic epidemic models, by conditioning the simulations on sets of validity criteria (based on the model structure) as well as the observed data. The flexibility of these techniques is illustrated using both removal time and final size data from an outbreak of smallpox. It is shown that these approaches can circumvent the need for reversible-jump MCMC, and can allow inference in situations where DA-MCMC is impossible due to computationally infeasible likelihoods.},

Virus and antibody levels were measured in respiratory tract washings, and antibody titers were measured in sera from infected animals. Individual B cells secreting specific antibody to A/Port Chalmers/72 virus were detected in regional lymph node and spleen preparations as early as 3 days and as late as 43 days after infection. T-cell assays showed an in vitro response of lymph node cells to A/Port Chalmers/73 virus from day 6 to day 43. Virus was isolated from the respiratory tract up to 7 days after infection. Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody was first detectable on day 6, with maximum titers reached by day 10.

@article{McLean2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that influenza vaccination in the previous season may influence the effectiveness of current-season vaccination, but this has not been assessed in a single population over multiple years.

METHODS: Patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2004-2005 through 2012-2013 influenza seasons. Respiratory swabs were tested for influenza and vaccination dates obtained from a validated registry. Vaccination status was determined for the current, previous, and prior 5 seasons. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated for participants aged ≥9 years using logistic regression models with an interaction term for vaccination history.

RESULTS: There were 7315 enrollments during 8 seasons; 1056 (14{\%}) and 650 (9{\%}) were positive for influenza A(H3N2) and B, respectively. Vaccination during current only, previous only, or both seasons yielded similar protection against H3N2 (adjusted VE range, 31{\%}-36{\%}) and B (52{\%}-66{\%}). In the analysis using 5 years of historical vaccination data, current season VE against H3N2 was significantly higher among vaccinated individuals with no prior vaccination history (65{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 36{\%}-80{\%}) compared with vaccinated individuals with a frequent vaccination history (24{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 3{\%}-41{\%}; P = .01). VE against B was 75{\%} (95{\%} CI, 50{\%}-87{\%}) and 48{\%} (95{\%} CI, 29{\%}-62{\%}), respectively (P = .05). Similar findings were observed when analysis was restricted to adults 18-49 years.

CONCLUSIONS: Current- and previous-season vaccination generated similar levels of protection, and vaccine-induced protection was greatest for individuals not vaccinated during the prior 5 years. Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of annual vaccination.},

Recently there has been considerable interest in linking within- and between-host levels of disease dynamics in the study of pathogen evolution. Here we review the extent to which these nested models have increased our understanding of pathogen evolution. We suggest that, although such models have been useful for determining the nature of tradeoffs between epidemiological parameters and for evaluating the consequences of conflicting selection pressures at different scales, the vast majority of previous results could likely have been obtained without the use of nested models per se. Nevertheless, these models have proven very useful through their highlighting of the importance of within-host disease dynamics on pathogen evolution.},

abstract = {Background: Knowledge of the age-specific prevalence of immunity from, and incidence of infection with, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus is essential for modelling the future burden of disease and the effectiveness of interventions such as vaccination. Methods: In this cross-sectional serological survey, we obtained 1403 serum samples taken in 2008 (before the first wave of H1N1 infection) and 1954 serum samples taken in August and September, 2009 (after the first wave of infection) as part of the annual collection for the Health Protection Agency seroepidemiology programme from patients accessing health care in England. Antibody titres were measured by use of haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation assays. We calculated the proportion of samples with antibodies to pandemic H1N1 virus in 2008 by age group and compared the proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more (deemed a protective response) before the first wave of infection with the proportion after the first wave. Findings: In the baseline serum samples from 2008, haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation antibody titres increased significantly with age (F test p{\textless}0??0001). The proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more ranged from 1??8{\%} (three of 171; 95{\%} CI 0??6-5??0) in children aged 0-4 years to 31??3{\%} (52 of 166; 24??8-38??7) in adults aged 80 years or older. In London and the West Midlands, the difference in the proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre equal to or above 1:32 between baseline and September, 2009, was 21??3{\%} (95{\%} CI 8??8-40??3) for children younger than 5 years of age, 42??0{\%} (26??3-58??2) for 5-14-year-olds, and 20??6{\%} (1??6-42??4) for 15-24-year-olds, with no difference between baseline and September in older age groups. In other regions, only children younger than 15 years showed a significant increase from baseline (6??3{\%}, 1??8-12??9). Interpretation: Around one child in every three was infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 in the first wave of infection in regions with a high incidence, ten times more than estimated from clinical surveillance. Pre-existing antibody in older age groups protects against infection. Children have an important role in transmission of influenza and would be a key target group for vaccination both for their protection and for the protection of others through herd immunity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the age-specific prevalence of immunity
from, and incidence of infection with, 2009 pandemic influenza A
H1N1 virus is essential for modelling the future burden of
disease and the effectiveness of interventions such as
vaccination. METHODS: In this cross-sectional serological survey,
we obtained 1403 serum samples taken in 2008 (before the first
wave of H1N1 infection) and 1954 serum samples taken in August
and September, 2009 (after the first wave of infection) as part
of the annual collection for the Health Protection Agency
seroepidemiology programme from patients accessing health care in
England. Antibody titres were measured by use of
haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation assays. We
calculated the proportion of samples with antibodies to pandemic
H1N1 virus in 2008 by age group and compared the proportion of
samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more
(deemed a protective response) before the first wave of infection
with the proportion after the first wave. FINDINGS: In the
baseline serum samples from 2008, haemagglutination inhibition
and microneutralisation antibody titres increased significantly
with age (F test p{\textless}0.0001). The proportion of samples with
haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more ranged from 1.8{\%}
(three of 171; 95{\%} CI 0.6-5.0) in children aged 0-4 years to
31.3{\%} (52 of 166; 24.8-38.7) in adults aged 80 years or older.
In London and the West Midlands, the difference in the proportion
of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre equal to or
above 1:32 between baseline and September, 2009, was 21.3{\%} (95{\%}
CI 8.8-40.3) for children younger than 5 years of age, 42.0{\%}
(26.3-58.2) for 5-14-year-olds, and 20.6{\%} (1.6-42.4) for
15-24-year-olds, with no difference between baseline and
September in older age groups. In other regions, only children
younger than 15 years showed a significant increase from baseline
(6.3{\%}, 1.8-12.9). INTERPRETATION: Around one child in every
three was infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 in the first wave of
infection in regions with a high incidence, ten times more than
estimated from clinical surveillance. Pre-existing antibody in
older age groups protects against infection. Children have an
important role in transmission of influenza and would be a key
target group for vaccination both for their protection and for
the protection of others through herd immunity. FUNDING: National

abstract = {Antigenic diversity shapes immunity in distinct and unexpected ways. This is particularly true of the humoral response generated against influenza A viruses. Although it is known that immunological memory developed against previously encountered influenza A virus strains affects the outcome of subsequent infections, exactly how sequential exposures to antigenically variant viruses shape the humoral immune response in humans remains poorly understood. To address this important question, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers against various pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza virus spanning a 20-year period (1987 to 2008) with samples from 40 individuals (birth dates, 1917 to 1952) obtained from the Framingham Heart Study. Longitudinal increases in neutralizing antibody titers were observed against previously encountered pandemic H2N2, H3N2, and H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Antibody titers against seasonal strains encountered later in life also increased longitudinally at a rate similar to that against their pandemic predecessors. Titers of cross-reactive antibodies specific to the hemagglutinin stalk domain were also investigated because they are influenced by exposure to antigenically diverse influenza A viruses. These titers rose modestly over time, even in the absence of major antigenic shifts. No sustained increase in neutralizing antibody titers against an antigenically more stable virus (human cytomegalovirus) was observed. The results herein describe a role for antigenic variation in shaping the humoral immune compartment and provide a rational basis for the hierarchical nature of antibody titers against influenza A viruses in humans.},

abstract = {The emergence of novel respiratory pathogens can challenge the capacity of key health care resources, such as intensive care units, that are constrained to serve only specific geographical populations. An ability to predict the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at the scale of a single large population would help to accurately assess the value of interventions designed to reduce that peak. However, current disease-dynamic theory does not provide a clear understanding of the relationship between: epidemic trajectories at the scale of interest (e.g. city); population mobility; and higher resolution spatial effects (e.g. transmission within small neighbourhoods). Here, we used a spatially-explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution to determine the effect of resolution on model-derived epidemic trajectories. We simulated an influenza-like pathogen spreading across theoretical and actual population densities and varied our assumptions about mobility using Latin-Hypercube sampling. Even though, by design, cumulative attack rates were the same for all resolutions and mobilities, peak incidences were different. Clear thresholds existed for all tested populations, such that models with resolutions lower than the threshold substantially overestimated population-wide peak incidence. The effect of resolution was most important in populations which were of lower density and lower mobility. With the expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets in the near future, our objective was to provide a framework for how to use these data correctly in a spatial meta-population model. Our results suggest that there is a fundamental spatial resolution for any pathogen-population pair. If underlying interactions between pathogens and spatially heterogeneous populations are represented at this resolution or higher, accurate predictions of peak incidence for city-scale epidemics are feasible.},

Here, we describe two mouse models of placental and fetal disease associated with in utero transmission of ZIKV. Female mice lacking type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1−/−) crossed to wild-type (WT) males produced heterozygous fetuses resembling the immune status of human fetuses. Maternal inoculation at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) or E7.5 resulted in fetal demise that was associated with ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetal brain. We identified ZIKV within trophoblasts of the maternal and fetal placenta, consistent with a trans-placental infection route. Antibody blockade of Ifnar1 signaling in WT pregnant mice enhanced ZIKV trans-placental infection although it did not result in fetal death. These models will facilitate the study of ZIKV pathogenesis, in utero transmission, and testing of therapies and vaccines to prevent congenital malformations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pandemic flu had at least two waves in Iran. Knowing how many of the general population were already exposed to this infection has a major impact on national preventive measures. As of December 30, 2009, a total of 3672 confirmed cases of human infection with a novel Influenza A (2009 H1N1) virus had been reported in Iran with 140 deaths. OBJECTIVE: In this study we aim to measure, as a pilot study, the seroprevalence of positive antibody titer (humoral immunity) against 2009 H1N1 virus in Iranian population in Shiraz, Southern Iran. METHODS: Through cluster random sampling of families residing in Shiraz, 2553 subjects were selected and after a medical interview blood samples were taken and checked for polyclonal antibody against 2009 H1N1 antigen using hemagglutination inhibition assay. An antibody titer of more than 1:40 dilution was considered positive. Data were analyzed considering the demographic characteristics of the population and were compared among different age groups. RESULTS: 1504 (58.91{\%}) samples were tested positive for the presence of polyclonal antibody against 2009 H1N1 virus. The prevalence of positive titers were significantly higher in 60 to 64 years old group and significantly lower in 20 to 24 years old group (p{\textless}0.05). Data did not differ based on other demographic characteristics or the history of flu like illnesses in the past 6 months. CONCLUSION: High seroprevalence of antibody against 2009 H1N1 in the sera of our subjects describes either a high level of pre-existing immunity against H1N1 in Iranian population or a high rate of asymptomatic infection in our area compared to other countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the impact of rubella vaccination strategies on the rates of acquired rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in the Americas. 

METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of the literature (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Artemisa Database, LILACS Database, Evidence Portal, VHL-PAHO Portal, Scielo, and Grey-Literature sources) that was published from 1969–2010. We included studies on rubella incidence and seroprevalence rates that were associated with rubella vaccination. The quality of the studies was evaluated according to international guidelines. 

RESULTS
A total of 14 studies were identified: 2 clinical trials, 2 cohort studies, 3 transversal studies, 5 ecological studies, and 2 mathematical models. Childhood vaccination reduced the incidence of rubella by 23.6{\%} to 99.6{\%}, increased the occurrence of epidemic cycles in Argentina and in the United States, and shifted the illness to susceptible adults. Vaccination strategies that focused on women and children in Brazil were associated with a 5.5-fold greater incidence of rubella in men leading to new outbreaks and CRS. A combined vaccination strategy with a universal approach that included routine vaccination for boys, girls, women, and men in Mexico and in Costa Rica reduced the incidence of rubella by more than 98{\%} and led to absence of CRS since 2008. A medium and a low risk of bias were found in 3 and 4 articles, respectively. 

CONCLUSION
The results of this review demonstrate that the combined vaccination strategy with a universal approach was the most effective strategy as evidenced by a drastic reduction in the number of cases and the interruption of endemic transmission of rubella in the Americas.},

Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 °C. These models are at odds with field observations of transmission dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25 °C (6 °C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at temperatures {\textgreater} 28 °C, altering predictions about how climate change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 °C optimum and the decline above 28 °C. Using these more accurate nonlinear thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission.},

There are many differences in reported assay methods and these changes may significantly affect results. This study evaluated the effect of changing erythrocyte concentrations, influenza virus concentrations used to sensitize erythrocytes, incubation times, and incubation temperatures. These factors were shown to significantly affect results of the SRH assay. A method for standardizing the assay and expressing results as relative antibody concentrations is described. Standardized relative antibody concentrations show significantly less variability than do hemolysis zone measurements when the SRH assay method is changed. This paper demonstrates that use of this method would allow for more consistent results to be obtained within laboratories. Use of this method with quantified, internationally standardized sera would allow results of the single radial hemolysis assay to be directly compared between laboratories.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have explored whether the antibody response to
influenza vaccination in elderly adults is as strong as it is in
young adults. Results vary, but tend to indicate lower
post-vaccination titers (antibody levels) in the elderly,
supporting the concept of immunosenescence-the weakening of the
immunological response related to age. Because the elderly in
such studies typically have been vaccinated against influenza
before enrollment, a confounding of effects occurs between age,
and previous exposures, as a potential extrinsic reason for
immunosenescence. We conducted a four-year study of serial annual
immunizations with inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines in
136 young adults (16 to 39 years) and 122 elderly adults (62 to
92 years). Compared to data sets of previously published studies,
which were designed to investigate the effect of age, this
detailed longitudinal study with multiple vaccinations allowed us
to also study the effect of prior vaccination history on the
response to a vaccine. In response to the first vaccination,
young adults produced higher post-vaccination titers, accounting
for pre-vaccination titers, than elderly adults. However, upon
subsequent vaccinations the difference in response to vaccination
between the young and elderly age groups declined rapidly.
Although age is an important factor when modeling the outcome of
the first vaccination, this term lost its relevance with
successive vaccinations. In fact, when we examined the data with
the assumption that the elderly group had received (on average)
as few as two vaccinations prior to our study, the difference due
to age disappeared. Our analyses therefore show that the initial
difference between the two age groups in their response to
vaccination may not be uniquely explained by immunosenescence due
to ageing of the immune system, but could equally be the result
of the different pre-study vaccination and infection histories in
the elderly.},

abstract = {In this study, we assessed the effects of the prevaccination titer and age on the immunogenicity of a low dose of influenza vaccine in children less than 4 years of age. A total of 259 children received two vaccine doses (0.1 ml for 0-year-olds and 0.2 ml for children 1 year of age or older) 4 weeks apart during the 2005/2006 season. The hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured before vaccination and 4 weeks after the first and second doses. The geometric mean titer, mean fold rise, seroresponse proportion (≥4-fold rise in titer), and seroprotection proportion (titer ≥1:40) were calculated for the prevaccination titer and age categories. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using the seroresponse and seroprotection proportions as dependent variables and the prevaccination titer and age as explanatory variables. As for the seroresponse against the H1 antigen after the first dose, the adjusted odds ratios of the prevaccination titers (versus {\textless}1:10) were 2.2 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8 to 5.8) at 1:10 to 1:20 and 0.14 (0.04 to 0.49) at ≥1:40. The corresponding figures for ages were 0.03 (0.01 to 0.07) for the 0-year-olds and 0.17 (0.08 to 0.34) for the 1-year-olds compared with the 2- to 3-year-olds (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001). Similar results were also obtained for the H3 and B strains. Significantly elevated odds ratios for seroprotection were observed with greater prevaccination titers and older ages for all strains. The prevaccination titer and age were independently associated with the antibody response in young children. The immune response was weaker in the younger children and those without preexisting immunity.},

abstract = {A new method is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses with equality and inequality constraints on the parameters of interest. The method is based on the fractional Bayes factor with a modification that the updated prior is centered on the boundary of the constrained parameter space under investigation. The resulting prior adjusted default Bayes factors work as an “Ockham's razor” when testing inequality constrained hypotheses, which is not the case for the fractional Bayes factor. Two different types of prior adjusted default Bayes factors are considered. In the first type, the updated prior is based on imaginary training data. Analytical and numerical examples show that this criterion converges fastest to a true inequality constrained hypothesis. In the second type, the updated prior is based on empirical training data. This second criterion only outperforms the fractional Bayes factor in the case of small samples.},

We review single scale models as they describe influenza infection from intracellular to global scales, and, in particular, we consider those models that capture details specific to influenza and can be used to link different scales. We discuss the few multiscale models of influenza infection that have been developed in this emerging field. In addition to discussing modeling approaches, we also survey biological data on influenza infection and transmission that is relevant for constructing influenza infection models. We envision that, in the future, multiscale models that capitalize on technical advances in experimental biology and high performance computing could be used to describe the large spatial scale epidemiology of influenza infection, evolution of the virus, and transmission between hosts more accurately.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is a re-emerging public health problem with two-fifths of the world population being at risk of infection. Till now, dengue fever was believed to be caused by four different serotypes. The fifth variant DENV-5 has been isolated in October 2013. This serotype follows the sylvatic cycle unlike the other four serotypes which follow the human cycle. The likely cause of emergence of the new serotype could be genetic recombination, natural selection and genetic bottlenecks. There is no indication of the presence of DENV-5 in India. Recent clinical trials with the promising Chimerivax tetravalent vaccine suffered a setback. Discovery of DENV-5 and more such sylvatic strains in future may further impede the Dengue Vaccine Initiative. Integrated Vector Management holds the key to sustainable dengue control. Further epidemiological and ecological studies are needed to detect additional sylvatic dengue strains.},

@article{Natale2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a set of growth curves for use as international standards in children up to age 5. The WHO's position is that all economically advantaged children who were breastfed as infants grow similarly. As a result, a single set of growth charts can be used to judge growth in any child, regardless of race or ethnicity. The goal of this study was to compare mean heights, weights and head circumferences from a variety of studies with the WHO's data.

DESIGN: We compared data from the WHO's Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) with data from studies performed in 55 countries or ethnic groups.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, SciELO, Google Scholar, Textbooks and Ministries of Statistics and Public Health.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Large recent studies (1988-2013) of economically advantaged groups, including comparisons with cohorts of breastfed children wherever possible.

RESULTS: Height varied somewhat among different national and ethnic groups. Means were generally within 0.5 of an SD of the MGRS means. Weight varied more than height, but the low MGRS means were seen as endorsing slenderness in the midst of an obesity epidemic. The mean head circumference varied widely. In many groups, means were consistently 0.5-1 SD above the MGRS mean. Head size in breastfed children at any age examined was far closer to local norms than to the MGRS means.

CONCLUSIONS: Height and weight curves may not be optimal fits in all cases. The differences between national or ethnic group head circumference means were large enough that using the WHO charts would put many children at risk for misdiagnosis of macrocephaly or microcephaly. Our findings indicate that the use of a single international standard for head circumference is not justified.

Antigenic properties are largely determined by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), and amino acid substitutions at exposed epitope sites in HA mediate loss of recognition by antibodies. Here, we show that antigenic differences measured through serological assay data are well described by a sum of antigenic changes along the path connecting viruses in a phylogenetic tree. This mapping onto the tree allows prediction of antigenicity from HA sequence data alone. The mapping can further be used to make predictions about the makeup of the future A(H3N2) seasonal influenza virus population, and we compare predictions between models with serological and sequence data. To make timely model output readily available, we developed a web browser-based application that visualizes antigenic data on a continuously updated phylogeny.},

There has been a growing concern over Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, particularly since a probable link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly in the baby was identified. The present study aimed to estimate a theoretical risk of microcephaly during pregnancy with ZIKV infection in Northeastern Brazil in 2015. 

METHODS
Temporal distributions of microcephaly, reported dengue-like illness and dengue seropositive in Brazil were extracted from secondary data sources. Using an integral equation model and a backcalculation technique, we estimated the risk of microcephaly during pregnancy with Zika virus infection. 

RESULTS
If the fraction of Zika virus infections among a total of seronegative dengue-like illness cases is 30{\%}, the risk of microcephaly following infection during the first trimester was estimated at 46.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 9.1, 84.2), comparable to the risk of congenital rubella syndrome. However, the risk of microcephaly was shown to vary widely from 14.0{\%} to 100{\%}. The mean gestational age at delivery with microcephaly was estimated at 37.5 weeks (95{\%} CI: 36.9, 39.3). 

CONCLUSIONS
The time interval between peaks of reported dengue-like illness and microcephaly was consistent with cause–outcome relationship. Our modeling framework predicts that the incidence of microcephaly is expected to steadily decline in early 2016, Brazil.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of original antigenic sin (OAS) states that the imprint established by an individual's first influenza virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. Subsequent influenza virus infection results in an antibody response against the original infecting virus and an impaired immune response against the newer influenza virus. The purpose of our study was to seek evidence of OAS after infection or vaccination with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (2009 pH1N1) virus in ferrets and humans previously infected with H1N1 viruses with various antigenic distances from the 2009 pH1N1 virus, including viruses from 1935 through 1999. In ferrets, seasonal H1N1 priming did not diminish the antibody response to infection or vaccination with the 2009 pH1N1 virus, nor did it diminish the T-cell response, indicating the absence of OAS in seasonal H1N1 virus-primed ferrets. Analysis of paired samples of human serum taken before and after vaccination with a monovalent inactivated 2009 pH1N1 vaccine showed a significantly greater-fold rise in the titer of antibody against the 2009 pH1N1 virus than against H1N1 viruses that circulated during the childhood of each subject. Thus, prior experience with H1N1 viruses did not result in an impairment of the antibody response against the 2009 pH1N1 vaccine. Our data from ferrets and humans suggest that prior exposure to H1N1 viruses did not impair the immune response against the 2009 pH1N1 virus.},

abstract = {Model parameter inference has become increasingly popular in recent years in the field of computational epidemiology, especially for models with a large number of parameters. Techniques such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or maximum/partial likelihoods are commonly used to infer parameters in phenomenological models that best describe some set of data. These techniques rely on efficient exploration of the underlying parameter space, which is difficult in high dimensions, especially if there are correlations between the parameters in the model that may not be known a priori. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the use of the recently invented Adaptive Metropolis algorithm for exploring parameter space in a practical way through the use of a simple epidemiological model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibody to influenza virus hemagglutinin has been traditionally associated with protection. Questions have been raised about its use as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy, particularly with regard to an absolute titer indicating seroprotection.

METHODS: We examined hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in subjects from a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines and compared titers in subjects with symptomatic influenza (cases) to those without influenza infection (noncases).

RESULTS: Prevaccination and postvaccination geometric mean titers were both significantly lower for cases compared with noncases in all intervention groups. Frequency of postvaccination seroconversion did not significantly differ for cases and noncases in either vaccine group. Among live attenuated vaccine and placebo recipients, cases were less likely than noncases to have postvaccination HAI titers ≥32 or 64. Nearly all recipients of inactivated vaccine had postvaccination titers of at least 64, and the small number of vaccine failures were scattered across titers ranging from 64 to 2048.

CONCLUSIONS: While HAI antibody is the major correlate of protection, postvaccination titers alone should not be used as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy. Vaccine failures from clinical trials need to be examined to determine why seemingly protective HAI titers may not protect. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00538512.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a recognized need to determine influenza
vaccine effectiveness on an annual basis and a long history of
studying respiratory illnesses in households. METHODS: We
recruited 328 households with 1441 members, including 839
children, and followed them during the 2010-2011 influenza
season. Specimens were collected from subjects with reported
acute respiratory illnesses and tested by real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza
vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination
in medical records or an immunization registry. The effectiveness
of 2010-2011 influenza vaccination in preventing
laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using Cox
proportional hazards models adjusted for age and presence of
high-risk condition, and stratified by prior season (2009-2010)
vaccination status. RESULTS: Influenza was identified in 78
(24{\%}) households and 125 (9{\%}) individuals; the infection risk
was 8.5{\%} in the vaccinated and 8.9{\%} in the unvaccinated (P =
.83). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness in preventing
community-acquired influenza was 31{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval
[CI], -7{\%} to 55{\%}). In vaccinated subjects with no evidence of
prior season vaccination, significant protection (62{\%} [95{\%} CI,
17{\%}-82{\%}]) against community-acquired influenza was
demonstrated. Substantially lower effectiveness was noted among
subjects who were vaccinated in both the current and prior
season. There was no evidence that vaccination prevented
household transmission once influenza was introduced; adults were
at particular risk despite vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine
effectiveness estimates were lower than those demonstrated in
other observational studies carried out during the same season.
The unexpected findings of lower effectiveness with repeated
vaccination and no protection given household exposure require
further study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No published meta-analyses have assessed efficacy and effectiveness of licensed influenza vaccines in the USA with sensitive and highly specific diagnostic tests to confirm influenza.

METHODS: We searched Medline for randomised controlled trials assessing a relative reduction in influenza risk of all circulating influenza viruses during individual seasons after vaccination (efficacy) and observational studies meeting inclusion criteria (effectiveness). Eligible articles were published between Jan 1, 1967, and Feb 15, 2011, and used RT-PCR or culture for confirmation of influenza. We excluded some studies on the basis of study design and vaccine characteristics. We estimated random-effects pooled efficacy for trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) when data were available for statistical analysis (eg, at least three studies that assessed comparable age groups).

FINDINGS: We screened 5707 articles and identified 31 eligible studies (17 randomised controlled trials and 14 observational studies). Efficacy of TIV was shown in eight (67{\%}) of the 12 seasons analysed in ten randomised controlled trials (pooled efficacy 59{\%} [95{\%} CI 51-67] in adults aged 18-65 years). No such trials met inclusion criteria for children aged 2-17 years or adults aged 65 years or older. Efficacy of LAIV was shown in nine (75{\%}) of the 12 seasons analysed in ten randomised controlled trials (pooled efficacy 83{\%} [69-91]) in children aged 6 months to 7 years. No such trials met inclusion criteria for children aged 8-17 years. Vaccine effectiveness was variable for seasonal influenza: six (35{\%}) of 17 analyses in nine studies showed significant protection against medically attended influenza in the outpatient or inpatient setting. Median monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine effectiveness in five observational studies was 69{\%} (range 60-93).

INTERPRETATION: Influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, but such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is lacking. LAIVs consistently show highest efficacy in young children (aged 6 months to 7 years). New vaccines with improved clinical efficacy and effectiveness are needed to further reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {Malaria transmission is strongly influenced by environmental temperature, but the biological drivers remain poorly quantified. Most studies analyzing malaria-temperature relations, including those investigating malaria risk and the possible impacts of climate change, are based solely on mean temperatures and extrapolate from functions determined under unrealistic laboratory conditions. Here, we present empirical evidence to show that, in addition to mean temperatures, daily fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant mean temperatures, temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures acts to speed up rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high mean temperatures acts to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at lower mean temperatures than currently predicted and can potentially block transmission at higher mean temperatures. If we are to optimize control efforts and develop appropriate adaptation or mitigation strategies for future climates, we need to incorporate into predictive models the effects of daily temperature variation and how that variation is altered by climate change.},

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching through MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health Library, as well as the epidemiological bulletins and alerts from the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control over the period 1954 to 2016.

RESULTS: The search yielded 547 records. We retained 333 for further analysis, to which we added 11 epidemiological bulletins from various sources. Of these, we systematically reviewed 52 articles and reports, revealing some epidemiological features and patterns of spread of the Zika virus worldwide, as well as pathological outcomes suspected to be linked to Zika outbreaks. Neurologic disorders among zika patients were similar in Brazil and French Polynesia but a causal link is not established. Incidence of zika infection in pregnant women is not known. In Brazil, during the zika outbreak the incidence of microcephaly increased more than 20 times. Among 35 infants with microcephaly, born from women suspected to have Zika infection during pregnancy in northeast Brazil, 74{\%} of the mothers reported rash during the first and second trimester.

CONCLUSIONS: On February 1, 2016, The World Health Organization declared the ongoing Zika crisis an emergency and that, although not yet scientifically proven, the link between the virus and growing numbers of microcephaly cases was "strongly suspected." However, the causal relationship between zika and microcephaly is not universally accepted. Public Health Implications.

DESIGN Retrospective survey and systematic review. SETTING Greece (population 10 million), 1950-95. SUBJECTS Children, adolescents, and women of childbearing age. RESULTS Around 1975 in Greece the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine started being given to boys and girls aged 1 year without policies to attain high vaccination coverage and to protect adolescents and young women. During the 1980s, vaccination coverage for rubella remained consistently below 50{\%}, and the proportion of pregnant women susceptible to rubella gradually increased. In 1993 the incidence of rubella in young adults was higher than in any previous epidemic year. The epidemic of congenital rubella that followed, with 25 serologically confirmed cases (24.6 per 100 000 live births), was probably the largest such epidemic in Greece after 1950. CONCLUSIONS With low vaccination coverage, the immunisation of boys and girls aged 1 year against rubella carries the theoretical risk of increasing the occurrence of congenital rubella. This phenomenon, which has not been previously reported, occurred in Greece.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The relationship between gestational age at time of maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and outcome of fetal infection is not well defined because the timing of maternal infection is usually not known. 

OBJECTIVE
To determine whether congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection following primary maternal infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is more likely to lead to central nervous system (CNS) sequelae than fetal infection due to maternal infection later in pregnancy. 

STUDY DESIGN
Using serum collected during pregnancy from mothers of newborns with congenital CMV infection, maternal infection was categorized as first trimester ({\textless}13 weeks) or later based on dates and results of IgG and IgM assays for CMV antibody. Outcome of congenital CMV infection was assessed by longitudinal fotlow-up of the infected cohort. 

RESULTS
Sensorineural hearing loss was found in 8/34 (24{\%}) of children in the first trimester group, compared with 1/40 (2.5{\%}) in the later infection group (P=0.01, relative risk, 9.6). Considering any CNS sequela (hearing loss, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, seizures, chorioretinitis) 11/34 (32{\%}) first trimester cases were affected compared with 6/40 (15{\%}) in the later infection group (P=0.07, relative risk 2.2). None of the later group had more than one sequela, compared with 4 (12{\%}) of the first trimester group (P=0.04). 

CONCLUSIONS
Children with congenital CMV infection following first trimester maternal infection are more likely to have CNS sequelae, especially sensorineural hearing loss, than are those whose mothers were infected later in pregnancy. However, some degree of CNS impairment can follow even late gestational infection.},

Recent reports of severe disease associated with ZIKV have greatly heightened awareness. It is anticipated that ZIKV will continue to spread in the Americas and globally where competent Aedes mosquito vectors are found. Dengue virus (DENV), the most common mosquito-transmitted human flavivirus, is both well-established and the source of outbreaks in areas of recent ZIKV introduction. DENV and ZIKV are closely related, resulting in substantial antigenic overlap. Through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), anti-DENV antibodies can enhance the infectivity of DENV for certain classes of immune cells, causing increased viral production that correlates with severe disease outcomes. Similarly, ZIKV has been shown to undergo ADE in response to antibodies generated by other flaviviruses. We tested the neutralizing and enhancing potential of well-characterized broadly neutralizing human anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) and human DENV immune sera against ZIKV using neutralization and ADE assays. We show that anti-DENV HMAbs, cross-react, do not neutralize, and greatly enhance ZIKV infection in vitro. DENV immune sera had varying degrees of neutralization against ZIKV and similarly enhanced ZIKV infection. Our results suggest that pre-existing DENV immunity may enhance ZIKV infection in vivo and may lead to increased disease severity. Understanding the interplay between ZIKV and DENV will be critical in informing public health responses and will be particularly valuable for ZIKV and DENV vaccine design and implementation strategies.},

abstract = {Influenza virus infection remains a public health problem worldwide. The mechanisms underlying viral control during an uncomplicated influenza virus infection are not fully understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model including both innate and adaptive immune responses to study the within-host dynamics of equine influenza virus infection in horses. By comparing modeling predictions with both interferon and viral kinetic data, we examined the relative roles of target cell availability, and innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling the virus. Our results show that the rapid and substantial viral decline (about 2 to 4 logs within 1 day) after the peak can be explained by the killing of infected cells mediated by interferon activated cells, such as natural killer cells, during the innate immune response. After the viral load declines to a lower level, the loss of interferon-induced antiviral effect and an increased availability of target cells due to loss of the antiviral state can explain the observed short phase of viral plateau in which the viral level remains unchanged or even experiences a minor second peak in some animals. An adaptive immune response is needed in our model to explain the eventual viral clearance. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the biological factors that can explain the viral and interferon kinetics during a typical influenza virus infection.},

A serological procedure for subtyping the NA glycoprotein is critical for the identification and classification of avian influenza (AI) viruses. The macroprocedure was first described in 1961 by Aminoff and was later modified to a microtiter plate procedure (micro-NI) by Van Deusen et al. (Avian Dis 27:745-750, 1983). The micro-NI procedure reduces the quantity of reagents required, permits the antigenic classification of many isolates simultaneously, and eliminates spectrophotometric interpretation of results. Although, the macro-NI has been shown to be more sensitive than the micro-NI, the micro-NI test is very suitable for testing sera for the presence of NA antibodies and has proven to be a practical and rapid method for virus classification. This chapter provides an overview of the USDA validated micro-NI procedure for the identification of subtype-specific NA in AIV and antibodies.},

Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time-averaged value and are based on population-level processes. Because many pathogens exhi-bit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within-host processes to FOI is needed. Specifically, within-host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short-lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual-level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simula-tions and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population-level FOI signal can be recovered from individual-level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual-level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross-scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual-based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood processes such as secondary infections, in population-level dynamics of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: End points used to detect influenza in vaccine efficacy trials have varied. Both the inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines are efficacious; however, failure to protect occurs.

METHODS: We compared characteristics of influenza A (H3N2) and B cases from 3 years of a comparative placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, and we evaluated the laboratory end points used to determine efficacy.

RESULTS: Although illness duration and reported symptoms did not differ by intervention, subjects with influenza in the inactivated vaccine group were less likely than those in the placebo group to report medically attended illnesses. All influenza type A (H3N2) and B cases isolated in cell culture were also identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). However, only 69{\%} of type A (H3N2) cases identified by rtPCR also were isolated in cell culture. Isolation frequency was lowest among live attenuated vaccine failures, a reflection of lower specimen viral loads. Among cases of rtPCR identified influenza A (H3N2), 90{\%} of placebo and 87{\%} of live attenuated vaccine recipients but only 23{\%} of inactivated vaccine recipients demonstrated serologic confirmation of infection.

CONCLUSIONS: In influenza vaccine efficacy studies, virus identification using rtPCR is the ideal end point. Isolation in cell culture will miss cases, and a serologic end point alone will overestimate inactivated vaccine efficacy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: End points used to detect influenza in vaccine
efficacy trials have varied. Both the inactivated and live
attenuated influenza vaccines are efficacious; however, failure
to protect occurs. METHODS: We compared characteristics of
influenza A (H3N2) and B cases from 3 years of a comparative
placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated
vaccines, and we evaluated the laboratory end points used to
determine efficacy. RESULTS: Although illness duration and
reported symptoms did not differ by intervention, subjects with
influenza in the inactivated vaccine group were less likely than
those in the placebo group to report medically attended
illnesses. All influenza type A (H3N2) and B cases isolated in
cell culture were also identified by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (rtPCR). However, only 69{\%} of type A (H3N2) cases
identified by rtPCR also were isolated in cell culture. Isolation
frequency was lowest among live attenuated vaccine failures, a
reflection of lower specimen viral loads. Among cases of rtPCR
identified influenza A (H3N2), 90{\%} of placebo and 87{\%} of live
attenuated vaccine recipients but only 23{\%} of inactivated
vaccine recipients demonstrated serologic confirmation of
infection. CONCLUSIONS: In influenza vaccine efficacy studies,
virus identification using rtPCR is the ideal end point.
Isolation in cell culture will miss cases, and a serologic end
point alone will overestimate inactivated vaccine efficacy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The main objectives of the present study were to establish the existence of significant differences in the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies (including microcephaly), signs of congenital infection, or foetal loss between Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected and non-infected pregnant women in western French Guiana. METHODS This prospective cohort study was conducted between January 1(st) and July 15(th) 2016. We evaluated the clinical and foetal ultrasound (US) examinations of 301 pregnant women with biological confirmation of ZIKV infection and 399 pregnant women who were negative for ZIKV infection. FINDINGS Overall, the total number of foetuses with CNS involvement in the infected group was higher than in the control group (9.1{\%} vs. 4.3{\%}; RR=2.11; 95{\%} CI [1.18, 4.13]). Anomalies of the corpus callosum and the presence of cerebral hyperechogenicities were also found to be significantly more common in the affected group. There was an increased risk of microcephaly (1.66{\%}) in the affected group compared with the control group (0.25{\%}), although this difference was not significant, unlike other signs of CNS and non-CNS foetal infection. When the mother was infected during the first or second trimester, there was a greater risk of more severe CNS involvement, the presence of more signs of infection and intrauterine foetal demise (IUFD). The vertical transmission rate in the exposed group was 10.9{\%} INTERPRETATION: ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with a significant risk of foetal CNS involvement and IUFD, particularly when the infection occurs during the first and second trimesters. Microcephaly was not present in every case of congenital Zika virus syndrome that we observed. Until more is known about this disease, it is paramount to evaluate suspected cases by detailed neurosonographic examination on a monthly basis, paying particular attention to the corpus callosum and the presence of hyperechogenic foci.},

abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus of significant public health concern. ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology compared with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), resulting in immunological cross-reactivity. Improving our current understanding of the extent and characteristics of this immunological cross-reactivity is important, as ZIKV is presently circulating in areas that are highly endemic for dengue. To assess the magnitude and functional quality of cross-reactive immune responses between these closely related viruses, we tested acute and convalescent sera from nine Thai patients with PCR-confirmed DENV infection against ZIKV. All of the sera tested were cross-reactive with ZIKV, both in binding and in neutralization. To deconstruct the observed serum cross-reactivity in depth, we also characterized a panel of DENV-specific plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for activity against ZIKV. Nearly half of the 47 DENV-reactive mAbs studied bound to both whole ZIKV virion and ZIKV lysate, of which a subset also neutralized ZIKV. In addition, both sera and mAbs from the dengue-infected patients enhanced ZIKV infection of Fc gamma receptor (Fc$\gamma$R)-bearing cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that preexisting immunity to DENV may impact protective immune responses against ZIKV. In addition, the extensive cross-reactivity may have implications for ZIKV virulence and disease severity in DENV-experienced populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) remains an unresolved but critically important question. METHODS We compared the characteristics of sporadic and clustered cases of human H5N1 and H7N9 infection, estimated the relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts, and the reproduction number (R). RESULTS We assembled and analyzed data on 720 H5N1 cases and 460 H7N9 cases up to 2 November 2014. The severity and average age of sporadic/index cases of H7N9 was greater than secondary cases (71{\%} requiring intensive care unit admission vs 33{\%}, P = .007; median age 59 years vs 31, P {\textless} .001). We observed no significant differences in the age and severity between sporadic/index and secondary H5N1 cases. The upper limit of the 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) for R was 0.12 for H5N1 and 0.27 for H7N9. A higher proportion of H5N1 infections occurred in clusters (20{\%}) compared to H7N9 (8{\%}). The relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts of cases compared to unrelated contacts was 8.96 for H5N1 (95{\%} CI, 1.30, 61.86) and 0.80 for H7N9 (95{\%} CI, .32, 1.97). CONCLUSIONS The results are consistent with an ascertainment bias towards severe and older cases for sporadic H7N9 but not for H5N1. The lack of evidence for ascertainment bias in sporadic H5N1 cases, the more pronounced clustering of cases, and the higher risk of infection in blood-related contacts, support the hypothesis that susceptibility to H5N1 may be limited and familial. This analysis suggests the potential pandemic risk may be greater for H7N9 than H5N1.},

abstract = {Influenza vaccines remain the primary public health tool in reducing the ever-present burden of influenza and its complications. In seeking more immunogenic, more effective and more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccines, the landscape of influenza vaccines is rapidly expanding, both in near-term advances and next-generation vaccine design. Although the first influenza vaccines were licensed over 60 years ago, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer is currently the only universally accepted immune correlate of protection against influenza. However, hemagglutination-inhibition titers appear to be less effective at predicting protection in populations at high risk for severe influenza disease; older adults, young children and those with certain medical conditions. The lack of knowledge and validated methods to measure alternate immune markers of protection against influenza remain a substantial barrier to the development of more immunogenic, broadly cross-reactive and effective influenza vaccines. Here, the authors review the knowledge of immune effectors of protection against influenza and discuss assessment methods for a broader range of immunological parameters that could be considered in the evaluation of traditional or new-generation influenza vaccines.},

abstract = {The potential rapid availability of large-scale clinical episode data during the next influenza pandemic suggests an opportunity for increasing the speed with which novel respiratory pathogens can be characterized. Key intervention decisions will be determined by both the transmissibility of the novel strain (measured by the basic reproductive number R0) and its individual-level severity. The 2009 pandemic illustrated that estimating individual-level severity, as described by the proportion pC of infections that result in clinical cases, can remain uncertain for a prolonged period of time. Here, we use 50 distinct US military populations during 2009 as a retrospective cohort to test the hypothesis that real-time encounter data combined with disease dynamic models can be used to bridge this uncertainty gap. Effectively, we estimated the total number of infections in multiple early-affected communities using the model and divided that number by the known number of clinical cases. Joint estimates of severity and transmissibility clustered within a relatively small region of parameter space, with 40 of the 50 populations bounded by: pC, 0.0133-0.150 and R0, 1.09-2.16. These fits were obtained despite widely varying incidence profiles: some with spring waves, some with fall waves and some with both. To illustrate the benefit of specific pairing of rapidly available data and infectious disease models, we simulated a future moderate pandemic strain with pC approximately ×10 that of 2009; the results demonstrating that even before the peak had passed in the first affected population, R0 and pC could be well estimated. This study provides a clear reference in this two-dimensional space against which future novel respiratory pathogens can be rapidly assessed and compared with previous pandemics.},

abstract = {During transmission of seasonal endemic diseases such as measles and influenza, spatial waves of infection have been observed between large distant populations. Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long-time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

Vaccines which can induce CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses in addition to strong antibody responses may be more effective in preventing disease since it has been demonstrated that CTL contribute to protective immunity, even against drift variants of influenza A viruses. The immunogenicity of two types of experimental influenza vaccines, which were based on immune stimulating complexes (ISCOM), were evaluated and compared with a conventional non-adjuvanted inactivated split virion vaccine, after immunization of human volunteers. In this randomized, double blind study, it was shown that the ISCOM vaccines altered the kinetics of the serum antibody response, resulting in more rapid titer rises against the vaccine strains. This accelerated antibody response coincided with enhanced in vitro proliferative T cell responses, which were observed shortly after vaccination. In addition, CTL responses were observed in a higher proportion of the vaccinees receiving an ISCOM vaccine, than in vaccinees receiving the conventional influenza vaccine.},

abstract = {In preparing for the threat of a pandemic of avian H5N1 influenza virus, we need to consider the significant delay (4 to 6 months) necessary to produce a strain-matched vaccine. As some degree of cross-reactivity between seasonal influenza vaccines and H5N1 virus has been reported, this was further explored in the ferret model to determine the targets of protective immunity. Ferrets were vaccinated with two intramuscular inoculations of trivalent inactivated split influenza vaccine or subcomponent vaccines, with and without adjuvant, and later challenged with a lethal dose of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) influenza virus. We confirmed that vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine afforded partial protection against lethal H5N1 challenge and showed that use of either AlPO(4) or Iscomatrix adjuvant with the vaccine resulted in complete protection against disease and death. The protection was due exclusively to the H1N1 vaccine component, and although the hemagglutinin contributed to protection, the dominant protective response was targeted toward the neuraminidase (NA) and correlated with sialic acid cleavage-inhibiting antibody titers. Purified heterologous NA formulated with Iscomatrix adjuvant was also protective. These results suggest that adjuvanted seasonal trivalent vaccine could be used as an interim measure to decrease morbidity and mortality from H5N1 prior to the availability of a specific vaccine. The data also highlight that an inducer of cross-protective immunity is the NA, a protein whose levels are not normally monitored in vaccines and whose capacity to induce immunity in recipients is not normally assessed.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization has declared Zika Virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the virus' emergence in multiple countries globally and the possible association of Zika virus with microcephaly and neurological disorders. There is a clear need to identify risk factors associated with Zika infection and microcephaly in order to target surveillance, testing and intervention efforts. Here, we show that there is a strong correlation between the incidence of Zika in Colombian departments and the force of infection (but not the crude incidence) of dengue, a virus transmitted by the same mosquito species, Aedes aegypti (R2 = 0.41, p{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, we show that there is also a strong correlation between the incidence of microcephaly in Brazilian states and the force of infection of dengue (R2 = 0.36, p{\textless}0.001). Because dengue, Zika and Chikungunya are transmitted by the same vector, these associations provide further support to the supposition that Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes microcephaly. In addition, they provide an opportunity to project the expected incidence of microcephaly in multiple dengue endemic locations across Colombia and the American continent. Detailed knowledge of dengue transmission should be use to target efforts against Zika and other flaviviruses.},

abstract = {From May to December 1997, 18 cases of mild to severe respiratory illness caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses were identified in Hong Kong. The emergence of an avian virus in the human population prompted an epidemiological investigation to determine the extent of human-to-human transmission of the virus and risk factors associated with infection. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the standard method for serologic detection of influenza virus infection in humans, has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of antibodies induced by avian influenza viruses. Therefore, we developed a more sensitive microneutralization assay to detect antibodies to avian influenza in humans. Direct comparison of an HI assay and the microneutralization assay demonstrated that the latter was substantially more sensitive in detecting human antibodies to H5N1 virus in infected individuals. An H5-specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also established to test children's sera. The sensitivity and specificity of the microneutralization assay were compared with those of an H5-specific indirect ELISA. When combined with a confirmatory H5-specific Western blot test, the specificities of both assays were improved. Maximum sensitivity (80{\%}) and specificity (96{\%}) for the detection of anti-H5 antibody in adults aged 18 to 59 years were achieved by using the microneutralization assay combined with Western blotting. Maximum sensitivity (100{\%}) and specificity (100{\%}) in detecting anti-H5 antibody in sera obtained from children less than 15 years of age were achieved by using ELISA combined with Western blotting. This new test algorithm is being used for the seroepidemiologic investigations of the avian H5N1 influenza outbreak.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There currently is a severe Zika Virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil and other South American countries. Due to international travel, this poses severe public health risk of ZIKV importation to other countries. We estimate the prevalence of ZIKV in an import region by the time a microcephaly case is detected, since microcephaly is presently the most significant indication of ZIKV presence. METHODS We establish a mathematical model to describe ZIKV spread from a source region to an import region. This model incorporates both vector transmission (between humans and mosquitoes) and sexual transmission (from males to females). We take account of population structure through a contact network for sexually active individuals. Parameter values of our model are either taken from the literature or estimated from travel data. RESULTS This model gives us the probability distribution of time until detection of the first microcephaly case. Based on current field observations, our results also indicate that the percentage of infected pregnant women that results in fetal abnormalities is more likely to be on the smaller end of the 1{\%}-30{\%} spectrum that is currently hypothesized. Our model predicts that for import regions with at least 250,000 people, on average 1,000-12,000 will have been infected by the time of the first detection of microcephaly, and on average 200-1,500 will be infectious at this time. Larger population sizes do not significantly change our predictions. CONCLUSIONS By the first detection of a microcephaly case, a sizable fraction of the population will have been infected by ZIKV. It is thus clear that adequate surveillance, isolation, and quarantine are needed in susceptible import regions to stop the dissemination of a Zika epidemic.},

There is a high risk to develop congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if the infection occurs in the first part of pregnancy, particularly in women without specific immunological protection. Specific therapies to prevent CRS are not available. Many developed countries have specific vaccination programs and maternal rubella is rare. However, in developing countries or where campaigns of rubella surveillance and preconceptional vaccination are inadequate, there are still cases of CRS registered despite primary possibilities of prevention. Maternal infection is not indicative of vertical transmission in 100{\%} of cases, and damage does not necessarily occur in all cases of fetal infection. This is the reason why an adequate prenatal counselling is mandatory, particularly in cases of proven maternal infection. Advanced prenatal diagnostic techniques, invasive or not, should be offered to the women especially in order to distinguish the cases without fetal damage. Prevention of voluntary interruption of pregnancy for the latter or in case of maternal false IgM rubella antibody positivity or IgM “chronic carrier” patients is mandatory. World wide, the aim is to perform an adequate primary prevention through vaccination of childbearing age women without specific immunological protection.},

representative human and avian H2 viruses and then analyzed the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine their
evolutionary characteristics in different hosts. The results of
longitudinal virus surveillance studies were also examined to
estimate the prevalence of avian H2 isolates among samples
collected from wild ducks and domestic poultry. Reactivity
patterns obtained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies
indicated antigenic drift in the HA of human H2 influenza
viruses, beginning in 1962. Amino acid changes were clustered in
two regions of HA1 that correspond to antigenic sites A and D of
the H3 HA. By contrast, the antigenic profiles of the majority of
avian H2 HAs were remarkably conserved through 1991, resembling
the prototype Japan 57 (H2N2) strain. Amino acid changes were
distributed throughout HA1, indicating that antibodies do not
play a major role in the selection of avian H2 viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed two geographic site-specific
lineages of avian H2 HAs: North American and Eurasian. Evidence
is presented to support interregion transmission of gull H2
viruses. The human H2 HAs that circulated in 1957-1968 form a
separate phylogenetic lineage, most closely related to the
Eurasian avian H2 HAs. There was an increased prevalence of H2

preceding the appearance of H2N2 viruses in domestic fowl. As the
prevalence of avian H2N2 influenza viruses increased on turkey
farms and in live bird markets in New York City and elsewhere,
greater numbers of these viruses have come into direct contact

to circulate in the avian reservoir and are coming into closer
proximity to susceptible human populations.},

We conclude that antigenically conserved counterparts of the human Asian pandemic strain of 1957 continue to circulate in the avian reservoir and are coming into closer proximity to susceptible human populations.},

abstract = {A simple single-radial-haemolysis technique is described that permits the detection and assay of antibody to influenza virus haemagglutinin. The method depends on the passive haemolysis of virus-treated erythrocytes by antihaemagglutinin antibody and complement. Under the "standard" test conditions described antibody to the other surface antigen of the influenza virus (neuraminidase) or to the internal antigens of the virus (nucleoprotein and matrix protein) do not produce haemolysis. Because it requires only small amounts of crude virus antigen and is rapid and simple, the method appears to be of considerable value for large-scale seroepidemiologic studies of new influenza virus variants. Antihaemagglutinin antibody detected by single-radial-haemolysis appears to be relatively strain-specific; the technique may therefore be useful in the antigenic characterization of virus isolates.},

Seasonal influenza vaccines have been available for decades, yet influenza remains a major public health threat in the US, sparking interest in studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccination. OBJECTIVES We sought to identify determinants of serological responses to inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines including number of doses, adjuvant, and subject characteristics. METHODS We reviewed 60 articles published between 1987 and 2006. We used weighted multiple logistic regression and random-effects models to evaluate how seroconversion and seroprotection rates varied with host and vaccine factors. RESULTS Both children and seniors tended to have poorer immune responses compared to adults whereas use of adjuvant and a second vaccine dose tended to improve immune response. Pre-vaccination serological status had a large impact on the immune response to vaccination. We found substantial heterogeneity among studies, even with similar population settings and vaccination regimen. CONCLUSIONS Future studies should stratify their results by pre-vaccination serological status in an effort to produce more precise summary estimates of vaccine response.},

abstract = {Assessing influenza A virus strains circulating in animals and their potential to cross the species barrier and cause human infections is important to improve human influenza surveillance and preparedness. We reviewed studies describing serological evidence of human exposure to animal influenza viruses. Comparing serological data is difficult due to a lack of standardisation in study designs and in laboratory methods used in published reports. Therefore, we designed a scoring system to assess and weigh specificity of obtained serology results in the selected articles. Many studies report reliable evidence of antibodies to swine influenza viruses among persons occupationally exposed to pigs. Most avian influenza studies target H5, H7 and H9 subtypes and most serological evidence of human exposure to avian influenza viruses is reported for these subtypes. Avian influenza studies receiving a low grade in this review often reported higher seroprevalences in humans compared with studies with a high grade. Official surveillance systems mainly focus on avian H5 and H7 viruses. Swine influenza viruses and avian subtypes other than H5 and H7 (emphasising H9) should be additionally included in official surveillance systems. Surveillance efforts should also be directed towards understudied geographical areas, such as Africa and South America.},

v2) but large between v1 and the current epidemic (e) strain (v1
{\$}\backslashneq{\$} e). Methods: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically
attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) illness was
estimated by test-negative design during 3 A(H3N2) epidemics
(2010-2011, 2012-2013, 2014-2015) in Canada. Vaccine
effectiveness was derived with covariate adjustment across v2

outpatients aged {\$}\backslashgeq{\$}9 years. Prior vaccination effects were
interpreted within the ADH framework. Results: Prior vaccination
effects varied significantly by season, consistent with the ADH.
There was no interference by v1 in 2010-2011 when v1 {\$}\backslashneq{\$} v2

abstract = {Advisory committees have cautioned that influenza vaccine-induced antibody declines more rapidly in the elderly, falling below seroprotective levels within 4 months.Weconducted a literature review to assess this assertion. The articles that were included in this review reported antibody levels [{\textgreater}=]4 months after influenza immunization in persons [{\textgreater}=]60 years old, interpretable in the Medicinal Products (CPMP) for the elderly. The final review included 14 studies; 8 of which reported seroprotection rates. Seroprotection exceedingCPMPcriteria was maintained [{\textgreater}=]4 months after influenza immunization in all 8 of the studies reporting this for the H3N2 component and in 5 of the 7 studies reporting this for the H1N1 and B components. In determining whether CPMP criteria were met at season's end, primary antibody response appeared to be more relevant than secondary antibody decline. Both studies reporting seroprotection rates that failed CPMP criteria [{\textgreater}=]4 months after influenza immunization for each of the H1N1 and B components had also reported failed seroprotection at 1 month after immunization. If initially achieved after immunization, seroprotection rates of 70{\%}-100{\%} were maintained not just at 4 months (2 studies) but also at 5 months (2 studies) and even at {\textgreater}6 months (4 studies), for the H3N2 and H1N1 vaccine components. Seroprotection rates appeared less consistent for the B vaccine component, throughout the postimmunization period. Seroconversion appears to vary substantially and inversely with preimmunization titers but not with age. In 2 of 6 studies reporting seroconversion alone,CPMPcriteria were still met at 4 months. In the other 4 studies, the main reason for failure at 4 months was primary failure at 1 month. A total of 6 studies compared antibody persistence by age, and no consistent differences were found on that basis. The historic concern that the influenza vaccine-induced antibody response in the elderly declines more rapidly and below seroprotective levels within 4 months of immunization should be reconsidered.},

Understanding the mechanisms involved in controlling an influenza infection within a host is important and could result in new and effective treatment strategies. Kinetic models of influenza viral growth and decay can summarize data and evaluate the biological parameters governing interactions between the virus and the host. Here we discuss recent viral kinetic models for influenza. We show how these models have been used to provide insight into influenza pathogenesis and treatment, and we highlight the challenges of viral kinetic analysis, including accurate model formulation, estimation of important parameters, and the collection of detailed data sets that measure multiple variables simultaneously.

The importance of dengue as a cause of neurological disease is uncertain. METHODS During 1995, all patients with suspected CNS infections admitted to a referral hospital in southern Vietnam were investigated by culture, PCR, and antibody measurement in serum and CSF for dengue and other viruses. FINDINGS Of 378 patients, 16 (4.2{\%}) were infected with dengue viruses, compared with four (1.4{\%}) of 286 hospital controls (odds ratio [95{\%} CI] 3.1 [1.7-5.8]). Five additional dengue positive patients with CNS abnormalities were studied subsequently. No other cause of CNS infection was identified. Seven infections were primary dengue, 13 secondary, and one was not classified. Ten patients had dengue viruses isolated or detected by PCR, and three had dengue antibody in the CSF. 12 of the 21 had no characteristic features of dengue on admission. The most frequent neurological manifestations were reduced consciousness and convulsions. Nine patients had encephalitis. No patient died, but six had neurological sequelae at discharge.

abstract = {RATIONALE: Antibodies to influenza hemagglutinin are the primary
correlate of protection against infection. The strength and
persistence of this immune response influences viral evolution
and consequently the nature of influenza epidemics. However, the
durability and immune determinants of induction of humoral
immunity after primary influenza infection remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The spread of a novel H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) virus in
2009 through an unexposed population offered a natural experiment
to assess the nature and longevity of humoral immunity after a
single primary influenza infection. METHODS: We followed
A(H1N1)pdm09-seronegative adults through two influenza seasons
(2009-2011) as they developed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection or
were vaccinated. Antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were measured
by hemagglutination-inhibition assay in individuals with paired
serum samples collected preinfection and postinfection or
vaccination to assess durability of humoral immunity. Preexisting
A(H1N1)pdm09-specific multicytokine-secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells
were quantified by multiparameter flow cytometry to test the
hypothesis that higher frequencies of CD4(+) T-cell responses
predict stronger antibody induction after infection or
vaccination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Antibodies induced by
natural infection persisted at constant high titer for a minimum
of approximately 15 months. Contrary to our initial hypothesis,
the fold increase in A(H1N1)pdm09-specific antibody titer after
infection was inversely correlated to the frequency of
preexisting circulating A(H1N1)pdm09-specific
CD4(+)IL-2(+)IFN-{\$}\gamma{\$}(-)TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}(-) T cells (r = -0.4122;
P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The longevity of protective humoral
immunity after influenza infection has important implications for
influenza transmission dynamics and vaccination policy, and
identification of its predictive cellular immune correlate could
guide vaccine development and evaluation.},

abstract = {Influenza is a major respiratory pathogen causing annual outbreaks and occasional pandemics. Influenza vaccination is the major method of prophylaxis. Currently annual influenza vaccination is recommended for groups at high risk of complications from influenza infection such as pregnant women, young children, people with underlying disease and the elderly, along with occupational groups such a healthcare workers and farm workers. There are two main types of vaccines available: the parenteral inactivated influenza vaccine and the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine. The inactivated vaccines are licensed from 6 months of age and have been used for more than 50 years with a good safety profile. Inactivated vaccines are standardized according to the presence of the viral major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin and protection is mediated by the induction of vaccine strain specific antibody responses. In contrast, the live attenuated vaccines are licensed in Europe for children from 2-17 years of age and provide a multifaceted immune response with local and systemic antibody and T cell responses but with no clear correlate of protection. Here we discuss the immunological immune responses elicited by the two vaccines and discuss future work to better define correlates of protection.},

A candidate antibody standard (07/150) was prepared from pooled plasma of persons given clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine. To test human and sheep antiserum, 15 laboratories used HI and neutralization and reassortant A/Vietnam/1194/2004, A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2), and A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4) viruses. Interlaboratory variation was observed for both assays, but when titers were expressed relative to 07/150, overall percentage geometric coefficient of variation for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was reduced from 125{\%} to 61{\%} for HI and from 183{\%} to 81{\%} for neutralization. Lack of reduced variability to clade 2 antigens suggested the need for clade-specific standards. Sheep antiserum as a standard did not reliably reduce variability.

abstract = {We investigate the transmission dynamics of a certain type of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus under experimental conditions. Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homogeneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus, but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to investigate the posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the infection chain on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value. Parameter estimates of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are also obtained. The results reveal a possible decline in viraemia in one of the two experimental outbreaks. Our model also suggests that individual infectivity is related to the level of viraemia.},

abstract = {Vaccine effectiveness may wane with increasing time since vaccination. This analysis used the Victorian sentinel general practitioner (GP) network to estimate vaccine effectiveness for trivalent inactivated vaccines in the 2012 season. A test-negative design was used where patients presenting to GPs with influenza-like illness who tested positive for influenza were cases and noncases were those who tested negative. Vaccination status was recorded by GPs. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-odds ratio) × 100{\%}. Estimates were compared early versus late in the season and by time since vaccination. Virus isolates were assessed antigenically by hemagglutination inhibition assay in a selection of positive samples and viruses from healthy adults who experienced a vaccine breakthrough were analyzed genetically. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimate for any type of influenza was 45{\%} (95{\%} CI: 8,66) and for influenza A(H3) was 35{\%} (95{\%} CI: -11,62). A non-significant effect of waning effectiveness by time since vaccination was observed for A(H3). For those vaccinated {\textless}93 days of presentation vaccine effectiveness was 37{\%} (95{\%} CI: -29,69), while for those vaccinated ≥93 days before presentation it was 18{\%} (95{\%} CI: -83,63). Comparison of early versus late in the season estimates was very sensitive to the cut off week chosen for analysis. Antigenic data suggested that low vaccine effectiveness was not associated with poor vaccine match among the A(H3) viruses. However, genetic analysis suggested nucleotide substitutions in antigenic sites. In 2012, the trivalent influenza vaccine provided moderate protection against influenza and showed limited evidence for waning effectiveness. Antigenic and genetic data can provide additional insight into understanding these estimates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
In 2015, the Zika arbovirus (ZIKV) began circulating in the Americas, rapidly expanding its global geographic range in explosive outbreaks. Unusual among mosquito-borne diseases, ZIKV has been shown to also be sexually transmitted, although sustained autochthonous transmission due to sexual transmission alone has not been observed, indicating the reproduction number (R0) for sexual transmission alone is less than 1. Critical to the assessment of outbreak risk, estimation of the potential attack rates, and assessment of control measures, are estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0. 

METHODS
We estimated the R0 of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, through an analysis of the exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases (n=359 to the end of November, 2015). 

FINDINGS
The rate of exponential rise in cases was $\rho$=0.076days−1, with 95{\%} CI [0.066,0.087] days−1. We used a vector-borne disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate the R0; assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we estimated the total R0=3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to sexual transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95{\%} confidence. 

INTERPRETATION
This is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, and also among the first quantifications of the relative impact of sexual transmission.},

abstract = {Serological techniques commonly used to quantify influenza-specific antibodies include the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) and Virus Neutralization (VN) assays. HI and SRH are established and reproducible techniques, whereas VN is more demanding. Every new influenza vaccine needs to fulfil the strict criteria issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in order to be licensed. These criteria currently apply exclusively to SRH and HI assays and refer to two different target groups-healthy adults and the elderly, but other vaccine recipient age groups have not been considered (i.e., children). The purpose of this timely review is to highlight the current scenario on correlates of protection concerning influenza vaccines and underline the need to revise the criteria and assays currently in use. In addition to SRH and HI assays, the technical advantages provided by other techniques such as the VN assay, pseudotype-based neutralization assay, neuraminidase and cell-mediated immunity assays need to be considered and regulated via EMA criteria, considering the many significant advantages that they could offer for the development of effective vaccines.},

Two hundred forty subjects (18-60 y: 120;{\textgreater}60 y: 120) were vaccinated. Immunogenicity end points were based on the European licensure criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines. Exploratory analyses assessed the cell-mediated immune response (CMI) up to Month 12 and the influence of previous influenza vaccination on persistence of immune response. At Month 6, the CHMP criteria were met in subjects aged 18-60 y who received one or two vaccine doses and in subjects aged{\textgreater}60 y who received two vaccine doses. At Month 12, the CHMP criteria were met only in subjects aged 18-60 y who received two vaccine doses. Persistence of HI immune response against the vaccine strain was higher in subjects without prior influenza vaccination. Exploratory analyses showed that two doses of the H1N1 2009 vaccine induced persistence of H1N1-specific CD4+ T cells up to Month 6 and memory B cells up to Month 12. In conclusion, HI immune responses persisted up to 12 mo after vaccination with one-dose and two-dose regimens of the AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 {\{}$\backslash$textmu{\}}g HA H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine, although not all three CHMP guidance criteria for both groups were met at Month 6 and Month 12.

METHODS We assessed the ophthalmological findings of ten mothers and their infants that had been clinically diagnosed with ZIKV-related microcephaly and presented ocular abnormalities, born from May to December 2015. RESULTS Seven mothers (70.0{\%}) referred symptoms during pregnancy (malaise, rash and arthralgia), of which six (85.7{\%}) were in the first trimester. At the time of exam, no ophthalmological abnormalities were identified in the mothers and they did not report ocular symptoms during pregnancy. Serology was negative in all infants for Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Syphilis and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses. Ocular findings included macular alterations (gross pigment mottling and/or chorioretinal atrophy) in fifteen eyes (75.0{\%}), and optic nerve abnormalities (hypoplasia with double-ring sign, pallor, and/or increased cup-to-disk ratio) in nine eyes (45.0{\%}).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza transmission in households is a subject of renewed interest, as the vaccination of children is currently under debate and antiviral treatments have been approved for prophylactic use. AIMS: To quantify the risk factors of influenza transmission in households. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective study conducted during the 1999 to 2000 winter season in France. SETTING: Nine hundred and forty-six households where a member, the index patient, had visited their general practitioner (GP) because of an influenza-like illness were enrolled in the study. Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of the 395 (77{\%}) households that completed the questionnaire, we selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of the index patient's visit to the GP. METHODS: Secondary cases of influenza were those household contacts who had developed clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and demographic characteristics of the contact and their index patient were derived from a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1{\%}) secondary cases occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26) as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients (HR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients (HR = 1.68, 95{\%} CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with transmission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our results support the major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38{\%} and 21-41{\%} of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in the household.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acquired immune responses to malaria have widely been
perceived to be short-lived, with previously immune individuals
losing immunity when they move from malaria-endemic areas.
However long-lived Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibody
responses lasting for an individual's lifetime are frequently
observed. METHODS: We fit mathematical models of the dynamics of
antibody titers to P. falciparum antigens from longitudinal
cohort studies of African children to estimate the half-lives of
circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and IgG
antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). RESULTS: Comparison of antibody
responses in the younger Ghanaian cohort and the older Gambian
cohort suggests that young children are less able to generate the
long-lived ASCs necessary to maintain the circulating antibodies
that may provide protection against reinfection. Antibody
responses in African children can be described by a model 15
including both short-lived ASCs (half-life range, 2-10 days),
which are responsible for boosting antibody titers following
infection, and long-lived ASCs (half-life range, 3-9 years),
which are responsible for maintaining sustained humoral
responses. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid decay of antibodies following
exposure to malaria and the maintenance of sustained antibody
responses can be explained in terms of populations of short-lived
and long-lived ASCs.},

Two different serological techniques were used, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and single-radial haemolysis (SRH) and, although each technique was reproducible within laboratories, variability between laboratories was higher for HI (maximum variability 32-fold; geometric coefficient of variation, GCV, 112{\%}) than for SRH (maximum variability 3.8-fold; GCV 57{\%}). The use of a standard serum allowed direct comparison of HI and SRH data and, for each technique, a standard serum improved inter-laboratory agreement. For influenza A viruses there was a correlation between HI and SRH antibodies (correlation coefficient approximately 0.9). An HI titre of 1:40 in human sera corresponded to an SRH titre of 19-33 mm2. The results of the study indicate that two sera would be expected to contain different antibody levels if their HI titres differed by {\textgreater} fourfold and SRH areas differed by {\textgreater} 50{\%}. Both SRH and HI possessed equivalent sensitivity for measurement of antibody to influenza A viruses but SRH was more sensitive for detection of antibody to influenza B viruses.

abstract = {Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and virus neutralisation (VN) assays are used to evaluate immunogenicity of pandemic H1N1 vaccines; however these bioassays are poorly standardised leading to inter-laboratory variation. A candidate International Standard (IS) for antibody to H1N1pdm virus (09/194) was prepared from pooled sera of subjects who had either recovered from H1N1pdm infection or who had been immunised with an adjuvanted subunit vaccine prepared from reassortant virus NYMC X-179A (derived from A/California/7/2009 virus). Ten laboratories from seven countries tested the candidate IS, 09/194 and a panel of human sera by HI and VN using the A/California/7/2009 virus (six laboratories) and/or the reassortant virus NYMC X-179A (ten laboratories). As expected, the inter-laboratory variability for HI and VN assay results was high. For results of antibody tests to NYMC X-179A, the {\%} geometric coefficient of variation ({\%}GCV) for 09/194 between laboratories was 83{\%} for HI and 192{\%} for VN. For tests of all sera, the median {\%}GCV ranged from 95 to 345{\%} for HI (80-fold variation) and 204 to 383{\%} for VN (109-fold variation), but for the titres relative to 09/194 the median {\%}GCV was much reduced (HI 34-231{\%}; VN 44-214{\%}). For tests of antibody to the A/California/7/2009 wild type virus there were similar reductions in {\%}GCV when 09/194 was used.These results suggest that 09/194 will be of use to standardise assays of antibody to A/California/7/2009 vaccine and 09/194 has now been established by WHO as an IS for antibody to A/California/7/2009 with an assigned potency of 1300 IU per ml. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The source, timing, and geographical origin of the 1918-1920 pandemic influenza A virus have remained tenaciously obscure for nearly a century, as have the reasons for its unusual severity among young adults. Here, we reconstruct the origins of the pandemic virus and the classic swine influenza and (postpandemic) seasonal H1N1 lineages using a host-specific molecular clock approach that is demonstrably more accurate than previous methods. Our results suggest that the 1918 pandemic virus originated shortly before 1918 when a human H1 virus, which we infer emerged before ∼1907, acquired avian N1 neuraminidase and internal protein genes. We find that the resulting pandemic virus jumped directly to swine but was likely displaced in humans by ∼1922 by a reassortant with an antigenically distinct H1 HA. Hence, although the swine lineage was a direct descendent of the pandemic virus, the post-1918 seasonal H1N1 lineage evidently was not, at least for HA. These findings help resolve several seemingly disparate observations from 20th century influenza epidemiology, seroarcheology, and immunology. The phylogenetic results, combined with these other lines of evidence, suggest that the high mortality in 1918 among adults aged ∼20 to ∼40 y may have been due primarily to their childhood exposure to a doubly heterosubtypic putative H3N8 virus, which we estimate circulated from ∼1889-1900. All other age groups (except immunologically naive infants) were likely partially protected by childhood exposure to N1 and/or H1-related antigens. Similar processes may underlie age-specific mortality differences between seasonal H1N1 vs. H3N2 and human H5N1 vs. H7N9 infections.},

There was a high attack rate (61 of 147), and a high rate of symptomatic disease (38 of 147), which resulted in frequent physician visits (25 of 38). Influenza accounted for 76 per cent of the sick-child visits during the two-month epidemic period. Young children undergoing primary influenza infection produced hemagglutination inhibition and antineuraminidase antibodies. Because of the immunologic responsiveness of young children, we examined the serologic correlates of protection. Ten children previously infected with influenza A/London and 16 who received live, attenuated A/Hong Kong ts-1[E] vaccine were protected against infection with the non-homologous A/Port Chalmers strain. The morbidity of influenza and ability of the young child to produce protective antibody should encourage evaluation of live, attenuated influenza vaccines in this...},

abstract = {The most salient feature of influenza evolution in humans is its antigenic drift. This process is characterized by structural changes in the virus's B-cell epitopes and ultimately results in the ability of the virus to evade immune recognition and thereby reinfect previously infected hosts. Until recently, amino acid substitutions in epitope regions of the viral haemagglutinin were thought to be positively selected for their ability to reduce antibody binding and therefore were thought to be responsible for driving antigenic drift. However, a recent hypothesis put forward by Hensley and co-workers posits that cellular receptor binding avidity is the dominant phenotype under selection, with antigenic drift being a side effect of these binding avidity changes. Here, we present a mathematical formulation of this new antigenic drift model and use it to show how rates of antigenic drift depend on epidemiological parameters. We further use the model to evaluate how two different vaccination strategies can impact antigenic drift rates and ultimately disease incidence levels. Finally, we discuss the assumptions present in the model formulation, predictions of the model, and future work that needs to be done to determine the consistency of this hypothesis with known patterns of influenza's genetic and antigenic evolution.},

@article{Zambon1999,
abstract = {Influenza A, B and C all have a segmented genome, although only certain influenza A subtypes and influenza B cause severe disease in humans. The two major proteins of influenza are the surface glycoproteins-haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is the major antigen for neutralizing antibodies and is involved in the binding of virus particles to receptors on host cells. Pandemics are a result of novel virus subtypes of influenza A, created by reassortment of the segmented genome (antigenic shift), whereas annual epidemics are a result of evolution of the surface antigens of influenza A and B virus (antigenic drift). The rapid evolution of influenza viruses highlights the importance of surveillance in identifying novel circulating strains. Infectivity of influenza depends on the cleavage of HA by specific host proteases, whereas NA is involved in the release of progeny virions from the cell surface and prevents clumping of newly formed virus. In birds, the natural hosts of influenza, the virus causes gastrointestinal infection and is transmitted via the faeco-oral route. Virulent avian influenza strains, which cause systemic disease, have an HA that is cleaved by proteases present in all cells of the body, rather than by proteases restricted to the intestinal tract. In mammals, replication of influenza subtypes appears restricted to respiratory epithelial cells. Most symptoms and complications, therefore, involve the respiratory tract. However, systemic complications are sometimes observed and other viral genes besides the HA, including the NA, may be involved in determination of virulence of influenza strains in mammals.},

abstract = {The immune responses to influenza, a virus that exhibits strain variation, show complex dynamics where prior immunity shapes the response to the subsequent infecting strains. Original antigenic sin (OAS) describes the observation that antibodies to the first encountered influenza strain, specifically antibodies to the epitopes on the head of influenza's main surface glycoprotein, haemagglutinin (HA), dominate following infection with new drifted strains. OAS suggests that responses to the original strain are preferentially boosted. Recent studies also show limited boosting of the antibodies to conserved epitopes on the stem of HA, which are attractive targets for a 'universal vaccine'. We develop multi-epitope models to explore how pre-existing immunity modulates the immune response to new strains following immunization. Our models suggest that the masking of antigenic epitopes by antibodies may play an important role in describing the complex dynamics of OAS and limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA. Analysis of recently published data confirms model predictions for how pre-existing antibodies to an epitope on HA decrease the magnitude of boosting of the antibody response to this epitope following immunization. We explore strategies for boosting of antibodies to conserved epitopes and generating broadly protective immunity to multiple strains.},
